Abstract

Can world knowledge learned by large language models (LLMs) be used to act in interactive environments? In this paper, we investigate the possibility of grounding high-level tasks, expressed in natural language (e.g. ‚Äúmake breakfast‚Äù), to a chosen set of actionable steps (e.g. ‚Äúopen fridge‚Äù). While prior work focused on learning from explicit step-by-step examples of how to act, we surprisingly Ô¨Ånd that if pre-trained LMs are large enough and prompted appropriately, they can effectively decompose high-level tasks into mid-level plans without any further training. However, the plans produced naively by LLMs often cannot map precisely to admissible actions. We propose a procedure that conditions on existing demonstrations and semantically translates the plans to admissible actions. Our evaluation in the recent VirtualHome environment shows that the resulting method substantially improves executability over the LLM baseline. The conducted human evaluation reveals a trade-off between executability and correctness but shows a promising sign towards extracting actionable knowledge from language models.

1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive advances in language generation and understanding in recent years [10, 39, 40, 5]. See [4] for a recent summary of their capabilities and impacts. Being trained on large corpora of human-produced language, these models are thought to contain a lot of information about the world [42, 23, 3] - albeit in linguistic form.
We ask whether we can use such knowledge contained in LLMs not just for linguistic tasks, but to make goal-driven decisions that can be enacted in interactive, embodied environments. But we are not simply interested in whether we can train models on a dataset of demonstrations collected for some speciÔ¨Åc environment ‚Äì we are instead interested in whether LLMs already contain information necessary to accomplish goals without any additional training.
More speciÔ¨Åcally, we ask whether world knowledge about how to perform high-level tasks (such as ‚Äúmake breakfast‚Äù) can be expanded to a series of groundable actions (such as ‚Äúopen fridge‚Äù, ‚Äúgrab milk‚Äù, ‚Äúclose fridge‚Äù, etc) that can be executed in the environment. For our investigation, we use the recently proposed VirtualHome environment [38]. It can simulate a large variety of realistic human activities in a household environment and supports the ability to perform them via embodied actions deÔ¨Åned with a verb-object syntax. However, due to the open-ended nature of the tasks, it is difÔ¨Åcult to autonomously evaluate their success. We rely on human evaluation (conducted on Mechanical Turk) to decide whether sequences of actions meaningfully accomplish posed tasks.
We Ô¨Ånd that large GPT-3 [5] and Codex [7] models, when prompted with a single Ô¨Åxed example of a task description and its associated sequence of actions, can produce very plausible action plans for the task we‚Äôre interested in. Such completions reÔ¨Çect the information already stored in the model ‚Äì no model Ô¨Åne-tuning is involved. Additionally, we only observe this effect in the larger models. Unfortunately, despite their semantic correctness, the produced action plans are often not executable in the environment. Produced actions may not map precisely to admissible actions, or may contain various linguistic ambiguities.
We propose several tools to improve executability of the model‚Äôs outputs. First, we enumerate all admissible actions and map the model‚Äôs output phrases to the most semantically-similar admissible action (we use similarity measure between sentence embeddings produced by a RoBERTa model [27] in this work, but other choices are possible). Second, we use the model to autoregressively generate actions in a plan by conditioning past actions that have been made admissible via the technique above. Such on-the-Ô¨Çy correction can keep generation anchored to admissible actions. Third, we provide weak supervision to the model by prompting the model with a known task example similar to the query task. This is somewhat reminiscent of prompt tuning approaches but does not require access to gradients or internals of the model.
Using the above tools to bias model generation, we Ô¨Ånd that we improve executability of action plans from 18% to 79% (see Figure 1) without any invasive modiÔ¨Åcations to model parameters or any extra gradient or internal information beyond what is returned from the model‚Äôs forward pass. This is advantageous because it does not require any modiÔ¨Åcations to the model training procedure and can Ô¨Åt within existing model serving pipelines. However, we do Ô¨Ånd there to be some drop in correctness of the action sequences generated with the above tools (as judged by humans), indicating a promising step, but requiring more research on the topic.
To summarize, our paper‚Äôs contributions are as follows:
‚Ä¢ We show that without any training, large language models can be prompted to generate plausible goal-driven action plans, but such plans are frequently not executable in interactive environments.
‚Ä¢ We propose several tools to improve executability of the model generation without invasive probing or modiÔ¨Åcations to the model.
‚Ä¢ We conduct a human evaluation of multiple techniques and models and report on the trade-offs between executability and semantic correctness.

Figure 2: We investigate the possibility of extracting actionable knowledge from pre-trained large language models (LLMs). We Ô¨Årst show surprising Ô¨Ånding that pre-trained causal LLMs can decompose high-level tasks into sensible mid-level action plans (left). To make the plans executable, we propose to translate each step into admissible action via another pre-trained masked LLM (middle). The translated action is appended to the prompt used for generating the remaining steps (right). All models are kept frozen without additional training.

2 Evaluation Framework
Simulating open-ended tasks that resemble naturalistic human activities requires an environment to support a rich set of diverse interactions, rendering most existing embodied environments unsuitable for our investigation. One exception is VirtualHome [38], which we evaluate on as it models complex human activities, though only in a household setting. To measure correctness of the generated action plans, for which evaluating computationally is inherently difÔ¨Åcult for these open-ended tasks, we conduct a human evaluation similar to Puig et al. [38]. We note that since no further training is involved throughout our investigations, the observations and Ô¨Åndings presented in this paper should also translate to similar embodied environments, likely even beyond the household domain.
2.1 Evaluated Environment: VirtualHome
Preliminaries In VirtualHome, activities are expressed as programs. Each program consists of a sequence of textual action steps, where each step is written as: [action] arg (idx). Each action refers to one of the 42 atomic actions supported in VirtualHome, such as ‚Äúwalk‚Äù and ‚Äúopen‚Äù. Full list of atomic actions can be found in Appendix A.4. Different actions take in different numbers of arg, such as ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù and ‚Äúfridge‚Äù, that are necessary for specifying an interaction. Associated with each arg is a unique id specifying the corresponding node in the environment graph, in case of multiple instances of the same object class are present in the graph. For the sake of simplicity, we omit the id in the remaining discussions of this paper and allow automatic assignment by the environment. An example program is shown below for the task ‚ÄúRelax on sofa‚Äù:
[WALK] living_room (1) [WALK] television (1) [FIND] television (1) [SWITCHON] television (1) [FIND] sofa (1) [SIT] sofa (1) [TURNTO] television (1) [WATCH] television (1)

Evaluated Tasks We use the ActivityPrograms knowledge base collected by Puig et al. [38] for evaluation. It contains 2821 different entries annotated by Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers. Each entry contains 1) a high-level task name (e.g. ‚ÄúWatch TV‚Äù), 2) detailed instructions expressed in natural language to complete the task (e.g. ‚ÄúSit on my couch directly opposite my TV, switch on my TV with the remote control and watch‚Äù), and 3) an executable program containing all necessary steps for a robotic agent (example above). We omit the use of detailed instructions (2) as we desire direct extraction of executable programs (3) from only high-level task names (1). There are 292 distinct high-level tasks in the knowledge base, from which we randomly sample 88 held-out tasks for evaluation. The remaining 204 tasks are used as demonstration set from which we are allowed

2.2 Metrics
A program that commands the agent to wander around in a household environment is highly executable but is mostly not correct. On the other hand, a program composed of natural language instructions annotated by humans is likely correct but cannot be executed, because its format is ambiguous and may lack necessary common-sense actions (e.g. fridge must be opened before an agent can grab things from it). We thus consider two axes for evaluation: executability and correctness.
Executability Executability measures whether an action plan can be correctly parsed and satisÔ¨Åes the common-sense constraints of the environment. To be correctly parsed, an action plan must be syntactically correct and contain only allowed actions and recognizable objects. To satisfy the common-sense constraints, each action step must not violate the set of its pre-conditions (e.g. the agent cannot grab milk from the fridge before opening it) and post-conditions (e.g. the state of the fridge changes from ‚Äúclosed‚Äù to ‚Äúopen‚Äù after the agent opens it). We report the average executability across all 88 tasks and all 7 VirtualHome scenes.
Correctness Unlike most embodied environments where the completion of a task can be easily judged, the ambiguous and multimodal nature of natural language task speciÔ¨Åcation makes it impractical to obtain a gold-standard measurement of correctness1. Therefore, we conduct human evaluations for the main methods. For the remaining analysis, we rely on a match-based metric that measures how similar a generated program is to human annotations. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we follow Puig et al. [38] and calculate the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two programs, normalized by the maximum length of the two. In the presence of multiple human-written programs for a single task, we take the maximum LCS across them. However, we note that the majority of the tasks only have one human annotation, but there are often many plausible ways to complete a certain task, making
1One approach could be measuring the similarity of the Ô¨Ånal environment state produced by executing predicted and human-written programs, but initial state must be kept Ô¨Åxed for each task, which are not appropriate for many tasks due to their open-ended nature.

this metric imperfect at evaluation program correctness2. Although correlation between the two is shown by Puig et al. [38], we consider it only as a proxy metric in replacement of unscalable human evaluation.
3 Method
In this section, we investigate the possibility of extracting actionable knowledge from pre-trained language models without further training. We Ô¨Årst give an overview of the common approach to query large language models (LLMs) and how it may be used for embodied agents in Section 3.1. Then we describe an inference-time procedure that addresses several deÔ¨Åciencies of the LLM baseline and offers better executability in embodied environments. We break down the proposed procedure into three individual components, each discussed in Section 3.2, 3.3, 3.4. Pseudo-code is in Algorithm 1.
Since LMs excel at dealing with natural language text instead of the speciÔ¨Åc format required by VirtualHome as described in Section 2.1, we only expose natural language text to LMs. To do this, we deÔ¨Åne a bi-directional mapping for each atomic action that converts between the natural language format and the program format. For instance, ‚Äúwalk to living room‚Äù is mapped to [WALK] living_room (1). Full list of the mappings is in Appendix A.4.
3.1 Querying LLMs for Action Plans
Previous works have shown that large language models pre-trained on a colossal amount of data would internalize rich world knowledge that can be probed to perform various downstream tasks [39, 5]. Notably, autoregressive LLMs can even perform in-context learning, an ability to solve tasks using only contextual information without gradient updates [5]. Contextual information is given as part of the input prompt and LMs are asked to complete the remaining text. It often consists of natural language instructions and/or a number of examples containing the desired input/output pairs.
We adopt the same approach to query LLMs to generate action plans for high-level tasks. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we prepend one example high-level task and its annotated action plan from the demonstration set to the query task, as shown in Figure 2. To obtain text completion results, we sample from autoregressive LLM using temperature sampling and nucleus sampling [18]. We refer to this LM as Planning LM and the approach using this LM for plan generation as Vanilla LM , where LM is replaced by speciÔ¨Åc language model such as GPT-3.
To improve the generation quality, we follow Chen et al. [7] to sample multiple outputs for each query. However, unlike Chen et al. [7] who investigate program synthesis and can choose the sample with highest unit test pass rate, we only consider the setting where one sample is allowed to be evaluated for each task. This is because repetitive trial-and-error is equivalent to probing the environment for privileged information, which should not be considered viable in our setting. For Vanilla LM , to choose the best action plan X‚àó among k samples (X1, X2, ..., Xk), each consisting of ni tokens Xi = (xi,1, xi,2, ..., xi,ni ), we select the sample with highest mean log probability as follows:
1 ni argXmi ax PŒ∏(Xi) := ni log pŒ∏(xi,j|xi,<j) where Œ∏ parameterizes the Planning LM. (1)
j=1
3.2 Admissible Action Parsing by Semantic Translation
One issue arises when naively following the above approach to generate action plans: the plan expressed in free-form language often cannot be mapped to unambiguous actionable steps and thus is not executable by a robotic agent. Many reasons can cause such failures: 1) the output does not follow pre-deÔ¨Åned mappings of any atomic action (e.g. ‚ÄúI Ô¨Årst walk to the bedroom‚Äù is not of the format ‚Äúwalk to PLACE ‚Äù), 2) the output may refer to atomic action and objects using words unrecognizable by the environment (e.g. ‚Äúmicrowave the chocolate milk‚Äù where ‚Äúmicrowave‚Äù and ‚Äúchocolate milk‚Äù cannot be mapped to precise action and object), or 3) the output contains lexically ambiguous words (e.g. ‚Äúopen TV‚Äù should instead be ‚Äúswitch on TV‚Äù).
2Although LCS has a mathematical range of [0, 1], we measure the LCS between different human-written programs for the same task and Ô¨Ånd an empirical maximum of 0.489.
6

Instead of developing a set of rules to transform the free-form text into admissible action steps, we propose to again leverage world knowledge learned by language models to semantically translate the action. For each admissible environment action ae, we calculate its semantic distance to the predicted action phrase aÀÜ by cosine similarity:
C(f (aÀÜ), f (ae)) := f (aÀÜ) ¬∑ f (ae) where f is an embedding function. (2) f (aÀÜ) f (ae)
To embed the output action phrase and environment actions, we use a BERT-style LM [10, 27] pre-trained with Sentence-BERT [41] objective, to which we refer as Translation LM3. The action embedding is obtained by mean-pooling the last layer hidden states across all tokens in that action phrase. While the set of admissible actions in our environment is discrete and possible to exhaustively enumerate, sampling or projection can be employed in larger discrete or continuous action spaces.

3.3 Autoregressive Trajectory Correction
Translating each step of the program after the entire program has been synthesized lacks consideration of achievability of individual steps and subjects to compounding errors. In practice, LLMs might output compounded instructions for a single step, even though it cannot be completed using one admissible action in the environment. To this end, we can instead interleave plan generation and action translation to allow for automatic trajectory correction. At each step, we Ô¨Årst query Planning LM to generate k samples for a single action (aÀÜ1, aÀÜ2, ..., aÀÜk). For each sample aÀÜ, we consider both its semantic soundness and its achievability in the environment. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we aim to Ô¨Ånd admissible environment action ae by modifying the ranking scheme described in Equation 1 as follows:

argmax max C(f (aÀÜ), f (ae)) + Œ≤ ¬∑ PŒ∏(aÀÜ) where Œ≤ is a weighting coefÔ¨Åcient.

(3)

ae

aÀÜ

Then we append the translated environment action ae to the unÔ¨Ånished text completion. This way all subsequent steps will be conditioned on admissible actions instead of free-form action phrases
generated by Planning LM. Furthermore, we can use Translation LM to detect out-of-distribution
actions, those outside the capabilities of a robot, and terminate a program early instead of mapping to a faulty action. This can be achieved by setting a threshold such that if maxaÀÜ,ae C(f (aÀÜ), f (ae)) + Œ≤ ¬∑ PŒ∏(aÀÜ) < at step t, the program is terminated early. Since we now sample Planning LM for individual steps instead of an entire sequence, another termination condition we consider is when > 50% of current-step samples are 0-length (excluding leading or trailing non-English text tokens).

3.4 Dynamic Example Selection for Improved Knowledge Extraction
So far in the text, we always give the same example in the prompt for all query tasks. However, consider the task of ‚Äúordering pizza‚Äù. Prompting LLMs with this task may give the assumption that the agent is initialized in front of a computer, and the LLMs may guide the agent to search for a pizza store and click ‚Äúcheckout my cart‚Äù. Although these are reasonable and feasible in the real world, such assumption cannot always be made as these interactions may not be supported in simulated environments. In fact, the closest series of actions that human experts give in VirtualHome may be ‚Äúwalking to a computer‚Äù, ‚Äúswitching on the computer‚Äù, and ‚Äútyping the keyboard‚Äù. Without being Ô¨Åne-tuned on these data, LLMs would often fail at these tasks.
To provide weak supervision at inference time, we propose to select the most similar task T and its example plan E from the demonstration set to be used as the example in the prompt. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we re-use the same Translation LM introduced in Section 3.2 and select (T ‚àó, E‚àó) whose high-level task name T ‚àó maximizes C(f (T ), f (Q)), where Q is the query task. This approach bears resemblance to several recent works [37, 13, 26, 43]. An example is shown in Figure 2 where ‚ÄúShave‚Äù is the most similar to the query task ‚ÄúApply lotion‚Äù.

FINAL METHOD Combining the various improvement discussed above, we refer to the Ô¨Ånal method as Translated LM , where LM is replaced by speciÔ¨Åc language model used such as GPT-3.
3Note that this is a different LM than the GPT-style Planning LM. Using a single LM for both purposes could as well be possible and likely more efÔ¨Åcient, but we leave such investigation to future works.

Figure 3: Visualization of VirtualHome programs generated by our approach. The top row shows the execution of the task ‚ÄúComplete Amazon Turk Surveys‚Äù, and the bottom row shows the task ‚ÄúGet Glass of Milk‚Äù. We show LLMs not only can generate sensible action plans given only high-level tasks but also contains the actionable knowledge that can be extracted for grounding in embodied environments.

4 Results
In this section, we Ô¨Årst show that language models can generate sensible action plans for many high-level tasks, even without any additional training. Then we highlight its inadequacy when naively applied to embodied environments and demonstrate how this can be improved by again leveraging world knowledge learned by LLMs. Visualization of generated programs is shown in Figure 3.
Sampling from LMs Pre-trained LMs are sensitive to sampling parameters and the speciÔ¨Åc example given in the prompt. For all evaluated methods, we perform hyperparameter search over various sampling parameters, and for methods using a Ô¨Åxed prompt example, we report metrics averaged across three randomly chosen examples. To select the best run for each method, we rank the runs by the sum of LCS and executability, each normalized by human-expert scores. Further details are in Appendix A.1.
Model Choices For Planning LM, we evaluate a representative set of causal language models. For Translation LM, we mainly use Sentence-RoBERTa-355M and provide relevant ablations in Section 5.3. GPT-3 and Codex are accessed using OpenAI API, and the remaining models are accessed through open-source packages, Hugging Face Transformers [55] and SentenceTransformers [41], all without additional training (except for the Ô¨Åne-tuning baseline).
4.1 Do LLMs contain actionable knowledge for high-level tasks?
We Ô¨Årst investigate whether LLMs can generate sensible action plans expressed in free-form language. We use the approach described in Section 3.1 to query pre-trained LLMs. To evaluate the correctness of generated action plans, we conduct human evaluations. For each model, we ask 10 human annotators to determine ‚Äì by answering ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù ‚Äì whether each task can be completed using provided action steps. To provide a reference of how humans might rate the action plans provided by other humans, we also ask annotators to rate the human-written action plans included in the VirtualHome dataset for the same set of tasks. In contrast to the free-form text output by LLMs, humans wrote the plans using a graphical programming interface that enforces strict syntax and a chosen set of atomic action vocabulary, which limit the expressivity and the completeness of their answers4. More details of our human evaluation procedure can be found in Appendix A.2.
We show the human evaluation results in Figure 1, where the y-axis shows correctness averaged across all tasks and all annotators. Surprisingly, when LLMs are large enough and without imposed syntactic constraints, they can generate highly realistic action plans whose correctness ‚Äì as deemed by human annotators ‚Äì even surpasses human-written action plans. We also observe some level of correctness for smaller models such as GPT-2. However, inspection of its produced output indicates
4 Puig et al. [38] also conduct a human evaluation on 100 randomly sampled human-written programs and show that 64% of them are complete (i.e. contain all necessary steps). Readers are encouraged to refer to Puig et al. [38] for a more comprehensive analysis of the dataset.

Although action plans generated by large language models can match or even surpass human-written plans in correctness measure, they are rarely executable. By translating the naive action plans, we show an important step towards grounding LLMs in embodied environments, but we observe room to achieve this without trading executability for correctness. We also observe a failure mode among smaller models that lead to high executability. For correctness measure, standard error of the mean across 10 human annotators is reported in the parenthesis.

that it often generates shorter plans by ignoring common-sense actions or by simply rephrasing the given task (e.g. the task ‚ÄúGo to sleep‚Äù produces only a single step ‚ÄúGo to bed‚Äù). These failure modes sometimes mislead human annotators to mark them correct as the annotators may ignore common-sense actions in their judgment as well, resulting in a higher correctness rate than the quality of the output shows.
4.2 How executable are the LLM action plans?
We analyze the executability of LLM plans by evaluating them in all 7 household scenes in VirtualHome. As shown in Table 1, we Ô¨Ånd action plans generated naively by LLMs are generally not very executable. Although smaller models seem to have higher executability, we Ô¨Ånd that the majority of these executable plans are produced by ignoring the queried task and repeating the given example of a different task. This is validated by the fact that smaller models have lower LCS than larger models despite having high executability, showing that this failure mode is prevalent among smaller models. In contrast, larger models do not suffer severely from this failure mode. Yet as a result of being more expressive, their generated programs are substantially less executable.
4.3 Can LLM action plans be made executable by proposed procedure?
We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed procedure of action translation. We Ô¨Årst create a bank of all allowed 47522 action steps in the environment, including all possible combinations of atomic actions and allowed arguments/objects. Then we use an off-the-shelf Sentence-RoBERTa [27, 41] as Translation LM to create embeddings for actions and output text. For better computational efÔ¨Åciency, we pre-compute the embeddings for all allowed actions, leaving minor computation overhead for our procedure over the baseline methods at inference time. As shown in Table 1, executability of generated programs is signiÔ¨Åcantly improved. Furthermore, we also observe improved LCS because the translated action steps precisely follow the program syntax and thus are more similar to the plans produced by human experts. Sample output is shown in Figure 1 and a larger random subset of generated samples can be found in Appendix A.5.
To validate their correctness, we again perform human evaluations using the same procedure from Section 4.1. Results are shown in Table 1. We Ô¨Ånd that despite being more similar to human-written plans as they follow strict syntax, the programs are deemed less correct by humans compared to their vanilla counterparts. By examining the output, we observe two main sources of errors. First, we Ô¨Ånd Translation LM is poor at mapping compounded instructions to a succinct admissible action, e.g. ‚Äúbrush teeth with toothbrush and toothpaste‚Äù. Second, we Ô¨Ånd that the generated programs are sometimes terminated too early. This is partly due to the imperfect expressivity of the environment;
9

certain necessary actions or objects are not implemented to fully achieve some tasks, so Translation LM cannot map to a sufÔ¨Åciently similar action. This is also reÔ¨Çected by our human evaluation results of the programs written by other humans, as only 70% of the programs are considered complete.

5 Analysis and Discussions

5.1 Ablation of design decisions
We perform ablation studies for the three components of our proposed procedure, described in Section 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 respectively. As shown in Table 2, leaving out any of the three components would all lead to decreased performance in both executability and LCS. An exception is Translated GPT-3 w/o Trajectory Correction, where we observe a slight improvement in LCS at the expense of a considerable drop in executability. Among the three proposed components, leaving out action translation leads to the most signiÔ¨Åcant executability drop, showing the importance of action translation in extracting executable action plans from LLMs.

5.2 Are the generated action plans grounded in the environment?

Since successful execution of correct action plans directly measures grounding, we calculate the percentage of generated action plans that are both correct and executable. We deem an action plan to be correct if 70% or more human annotators decide it is correct. Human-written plans are 100% executable, of which 65.91% are deemed correct. Results for LMs are shown in Figure 4.
Although smaller LMs such as GPT-2 can generate highly executable action plans as shown in Table 1, these executable plans mostly are not correct, as they often repeat the given example or do not contain all necessary steps. Increasing model parameters can lead to some improvement in generating plans that are both executable and correct, yet it scales poorly with the parameter count. In the meantime, action translation offers a promising way towards grounding actionable knowledge by producing executable and correct plans, though a large gap remains to be closed to reach human-level performance (65.91%).

5.3 Effect of Different Translation LMs
In this section, we study the effect of using different Translation LM. We compare two size variants of Sentence BERT and Sentence RoBERTa [10, 27, 41] trained on the STS benchmark [6] and a baseline using averaged GloVe embeddings [35]. Results are shown in Table 3. Notably, we do not observe signiÔ¨Åcant differences in executability and LCS across different variants of BERT and RoBERTa. We hypothesize that this is because any language models trained on reasonably large datasets should be capable of the single-step action phrase translation considered in this work. However, simply using average GloVe embeddings would lead to signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced performance.

5.4 Can LLMs generate actionable programs by following step-by-step instructions?
Prior works often focus on translating step-by-step instructions into executable programs. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, instead of only providing a high-level task name, how-to instructions are also provided, as shown in Figure 5. Although this setting is easier as it does not require rich prior knowledge, how-to instructions can help resolve much ambiguity of exactly how to perform a high-level task when multiple solutions are possible. To investigate whether pre-trained LLMs are capable of doing this without additional training, we include these instructions in the prompt and evaluate LLMs with the proposed procedure. We compare to a supervised baseline from VirtualHome that trains an LSTM [17] from scratch on human-annotated data. Since the code to train the baseline is not publicly released and a different train/test split is likely used, we only show results reported in Puig et al. [38] as a crude reference. We also cannot compare executability as it is not reported. Results are shown in Table 4. Surprisingly, without being Ô¨Åne-tuned on any domain data, Translated Codex/GPT-3 can attain LCS close to supervised methods while generating highly executable programs.

5.5 Analysis of program length
Shorter programs have a natural advantage of being more executable as they need to satisfy less pre/post-conditions, albeit being prone to incompleteness. To validate the proposed approach does not simply generate very short programs, we calculate the average program length across the 88 evaluated tasks. Results are shown in Table 5. Mirroring the observations made in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, we Ô¨Ånd smaller LMs such as GPT-2 tend to generate shorter programs than larger models do while frequently repeating the given executable example. In contrast, larger models like Codex and GPT-3 can generate more expressive programs with high realism, yet consequently, they often suffer from executability. We show proposed procedure can Ô¨Ånd appropriate balance and is capable of generating programs that are highly executable while maintaining reasonable expressiveness as measured by program length.

6 Related Works
Large-scale natural language modeling has witnessed rapid advances since the inception of the Transformer architecture [53]. It has been shown by recent works that large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on large unstructured text corpus not only can perform strongly on various down-stream NLP tasks [10, 39, 40, 5] but the learned representations can also be used to model relations of entities [23], retrieve matching visual features [19], synthesize code from docstrings [15, 7], solve math problems [8, 46], and even as valuable priors when applied to diverse tasks from different modalities [28, 52]. Notably, by pre-training on large-scale data, these models can also internalize an implicit knowledge base containing rich information about the world from which factual answers (e.g. ‚ÄúDante was born in PLACE ‚Äù) can be extracted [36, 21, 9, 50, 42]. Compared to prior works in single-step knowledge extraction, we aim to extract sequential action plans to complete open-ended human activities while satisfying various constraints of an interactive environment.
Many prior works have looked into grounding natural language in embodied environments. A series of them parse language instructions into formal logic or rely mainly on lexical analysis to resolve various linguistic ambiguities for embodied agents [2, 33, 34, 51]. However, they often require many hand-designed rules or scale inadequately to more complex tasks and environments. Recently, many efforts have been put into creating more realistic environments with the goal to further advances in this area [38, 47, 48, 22, 44, 1]. At the same time, by leveraging the better representation power of neural architectures, a number of works have looked into creating instruction-following agents that can perform manipulation [29, 30], navigation [11, 54, 31], or both [49, 16, 12]. Recent works also use language as hierarchical abstractions to plan actions using imitation learning [45] and to guide exploration in reinforcement learning [32].
Notably, many prior works do not leverage full-blown pre-trained LLMs; most investigate smaller LMs that require considerable domain-speciÔ¨Åc data for Ô¨Åne-tuning to obtain reasonable performance. Perhaps more importantly, few works have evaluated LLMs in an embodiment setting that realizes the full potential of the actionable knowledge these models already contain by pre-training on large-scale unstructured text: the tasks evaluated are often generated from a handful of templates, which do not resemble the highly diverse activities that humans perform in daily lives [14, 20]. The development of VirtualHome environment [38] enables such possibility. However, relevant works [38, 25] rely on human-annotated data and perform supervised training from scratch. Due to the lack of rich world knowledge, these models can only generate action plans given detailed instructions of how to act or video demonstrations. Concurrent work by Li et al. [24] validates similar hypothesis that
12

LMs contain rich actionable knowledge. They Ô¨Åne-tune GPT-2 with demonstrations to incorporate environment context and to predict actions in VirtualHome, and evaluate on tasks that are generated from pre-deÔ¨Åned predicates. In contrast, we investigate existing knowledge in LLMs without any additional training and evaluate on human activity tasks expressed in free-form language.
7 Conclusion, Limitations & Future Work
In this work, we investigate actionable knowledge already contained in pre-trained LLMs without any additional training. We present several techniques to extract this knowledge to perform common-sense grounding by planning actions for complex human activities. Despite promising Ô¨Åndings, there remain several limitations of this work which we discuss as follows:
Drop in Correctness Although our approach can signiÔ¨Åcantly improve executability of the generated plans, we observe a considerable drop in correctness. In addition to the errors caused by the proposed action translation (discussed in Section 4.3), this is partially attributed to the limited expressivity of VirtualHome, as it may not support all necessary actions to fully complete all evaluated tasks (correctness is judged by humans). This is also reÔ¨Çected by that Vanilla LMs can even surpass human-written plans, which are restricted by environment expressivity.
Mid-Level Grounding Instead of grounding the LLM generation to low-level actions by using downstream data from a speciÔ¨Åc environment, we focus on high-level to mid-level grounding such that we evaluate raw knowledge of LLMs as closely and broadly as possible. Hence, we only consider the most prominent challenge in mid-level grounding that the generated plans must satisfy all common-sense constraints (characterized by executability metric). As a result, we assume there is a low-level controller that can execute these mid-level actions (such as ‚Äúgrab cup‚Äù), and we do not investigate the usefulness of LLMs for low-level sensorimotor behavior grounding. To perform sensorimotor grounding, such as navigation and interaction mask prediction, domain-speciÔ¨Åc data and Ô¨Åne-tuning are likely required.
Ignorant of Environment Context We do not incorporate observation context or feedback into our models. To some extent, we approach LLMs in the same way as how VirtualHome asks human annotators to write action plans for a given human activity by imagination, in which case humans similarly do not observe environment context. Similar to human-written plans, we assume the plans generated by LMs only refer to one instance of each object class. As a result, successful plan generation for tasks like ‚Äústack two plates on the right side of a cup‚Äù is not possible.
Evaluation Protocol We measure quality of plans by a combination of executability and correctness instead of one straightforward metric. To the best of our knowledge, there isn‚Äôt a known way to computationally assess the semantic correctness of the plans due to the tasks‚Äô open-ended and multi-modal nature. Prior work also adopt similar combination of metrics [38]. We report two metrics individually to shine light on the deÔ¨Åciencies of existing LLMs which we hope could provide insights for future works. To provide a holistic view, we report results by combining two metrics in Section 5.2. We believe addressing each of these shortcoming will lead to exciting future directions. We also hope these Ô¨Åndings can inspire future investigations into using pre-trained LMs for goal-driven decision-making problems and grounding the learned knowledge in embodied environments.

Description
Out-of-distribution early termination threshold
sampling parameter adjusting relative token probabilities
number of samples generated by Planning LM
weighting coefÔ¨Åcient in action translation to trade off semantic and translation correctness
OpenAI API only; penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far
OpenAI API only; penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far
Hugging Face Transformers only; penalize new tokens based on whether repeating existing text

Search Values {0, 0.4, 0.8} {0.1, 0.3, 0.6} {1, 10} {0.3}
{0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9}

A.2 Details of Human Evaluations Human evaluations are conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. For each method, we generate action plans for all 88 high-level tasks. To account for the expressivity of the VirtualHome environment [38], we include action plans written by human experts from the VirtualHome dataset as references in our human evaluations. The evaluations are conducted in the form of questionnaires containing all action plans whose order is randomly shufÔ¨Çed and whose corresponding methods are unknown to the annotators. Human annotators are required to answer all the questions in the questionnaire. For each question, the annotators need to answer either ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù indicating if they believe the action plan completes the task. For each method, we report correctness percentage averaged across 10 participated human annotators and all 88 tasks. We further report the standard error of the mean across human annotators. Screenshot can be found in Figure 6.

A.4 Natural Language Templates for All Atomic Actions

VirtualHome requires action steps speciÔ¨Åed in a speciÔ¨Åc format, yet language models are trained to deal with mostly natural language. We thus deÔ¨Åne a natural language template for each atomic action and only expose the converted natural language text in all operations involving language models, i.e. autoregressive generation and action translation. After we obtain an entire generated program expressed in natural language, such as those in Figure 1 and Figure 2, we then convert each action step to the VirtualHome syntax. Full list of the atomic actions and their natural language templates can be found below.
