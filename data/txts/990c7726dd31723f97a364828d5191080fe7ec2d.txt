Majorana-based quantum gates are not complete for performing universal topological quantum computation while Fibonacci-based gates are diﬃcult to be realized electronically and hardly coincide with the conventional quantum circuit models. In Ref. [1], it has been shown that a strongly correlated Majorana edge mode in a chiral topological superconductor can be decomposed into a Fibobacci anyon τ and a thermal operator anyon ε in the tricritical Ising model. The deconﬁnement of τ and ε via the interaction between the fermion modes yields the anyon collisions and gives the braiding of either τ or ε. With these braidings, the complete members of a set of universal gates, the Pauli gates, the Hadamard gate and extra phase gates for 1-qubit as well as controlled-not gate for 2-qubits, are topologically assembled. Encoding quantum information and reading out the computation results can be carried out through electric signals. With the sparse-dense mixed encodings, we set up the quantum circuit where the controlled-not gate turns out to be a probabilistic gate and design the corresponding devices with thin ﬁlms of the chiral topological superconductor. As an example of the universal topological quantum computing, we show the application to Shor’s integer factorization algorithm.

I. INTRODUCTION
The idea of quantum computation can be traced back to the 1980s by Manin, Benioﬀ, and Feynman et al., who tried to simulate the quantum world by coherent quantum states and quantum models [2–4]. In the 1990s, Shor’s integer factorization algorithm provides a theoretical example of the applications of quantum computation, which has an enormous advantage over its classical counterpart [5]. Nowadays, the realizations and applications of quantum computation have become one of the most frontier topics in the developments of quantum technology [6]. In the attempts of constructing the prototypes of quantum computers, there have been proposals based on the entangled states of photons [7], superconducting circuits [8], bound states in cold atoms [9] or optical lattices [10], quantum wells [11], quantum dot spins [12], single spins in diamonds [13], Bose-Einstein condensates [14], rare-earth atoms [15], and carbon nanospheres [16]. Though quantum computing provides promising applications in quantum simulation, data mining, machine learning, deciphering, artiﬁcial intelligence, etc., the road to realizing the quantum computation remains tough. In the theoretical side, besides predicting material realizations, another serious challenge lies in making the quantum computation universal, i.e., to realize a protocol for universal quantum computation based on quantum sys-

tems and quantum logic gates such as the controlled-not (CNOT) gate. While in the experimental side, one serious challenge is the decoherence between the quantum states and the environment which will cause errors. For example, to create an error-tolerant logic gate for a singlet logic qubit, more than 150 physical logic gates are needed when processing in Steane codes [17, 18].
A. Topological Quantum Computation
Recent progresses on topological quantum states of matter have shed new light on overcoming these obstacles. The concept of topological quantum computation (TQC) was ﬁrst proposed by Kitaev [19, 20], which is believed to be fault-tolerant due to the protection of the topological gap between the system and the environment. The computational data is stored non-locally by the topological excitations, namely, anyons. In the TQC, the initial data is prepared by coherent many-particle anyon states. The braidings between anyons generate unitary transformations that correspond to logic gates and the readout of the results are achieved by fusing the anyons into observable quantities [21].
The concept of anyon was proposed by Leinaas and Myrheim [22], and Wilczek [23]. Laughlin pointed out that the quasi-particles with fractional charge in the fractional quantum Hall eﬀects (FQHE) could be anyons. In the ν = 5/2 even denominator FQHE, Moore and Read noticed that the non-Abelian anyons are of Ising type [24, 25]. Later, Freedman et al. proved that to achieve universal quantum computation, the topological quan-

tum gates with these Ising type non-Abelian anyons alone are not enough, and additional non-topological phase gates, e.g., the π8 gate, are needed [26]. Among the possible non-Abelian anyon systems, the Fibonacci anyon is the simplest case for achieving universal TQC [20], which is likely to exist in FQHE with ν = 12/5 [27, 28], but there are substantial uncertainties. A recent study reported the possibility that the Fibonacci anyon appears in the ν = 32 FQHE, appropriately proximitized by a superconductor [29, 30]. But this requires the survival of the superconductivity in a strong magnetic ﬁeld.
Besides FQHE, Kitaev proposed Majorana bound states at the two ends of topological superconducting quantum wires [31]. Two Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at the two ends have a π/2 phase shift. They correspond to the ”real” and ”imaginary” part of a non-local fermion. Except for the phase diﬀerence, the higher dimensional non-Abelian representations of the braid group of the MZMs are equivalent to the Ising type anyons’ [32–34]. Some quantum gates for TQC can be achieved by exchanging the Majorana bound states in so-called T-junctions [34]. Unfortunately, the MZMs also suffer from lacking of topological phase gates for universal TQC. Even so, Kitaev’s seminal work has stimulated the physicists’ enthusiasm for ﬁnding MZMs. Using the proximity eﬀect of the s-wave superconductor, Fu and Kane proposed a theory for MZM in the superconducting vortex at the interface between an swave superconductor and a topological insulator [35]. There are other proposals for MZMs in semiconductor heterostructures [36], semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures [37], superconductor/2D-topologicalinsulator/ferromagnetic-insulator hybrid system [38], and so on. Besides the progresses on the theories, there are also lots of experimental reports on MZMs. Midgap states at zero bias voltage were observed in indium antimonide nanowires in a magnetic ﬁeld [39–43]. Although the results are consistent with the existence of MZMs [37], the zero energy states can also be explained by other non-topological trivial bound states [44]. Possible MZMs were observed at the ferromagnetic atomic chains on a superconductor [45], but there can be other explanations besides MZM. A strong indirect evidence for MZM was observed in Bi2Te3/NbSe2 heterostructure [46, 47]. A 2e2/h conductance was observed in InSb nanowire, which is believed to be an evidence for MZM [48], but this result was retracted. And the authors’ latest data show more possible interpretations besides MZM [49]. Recently, the evidences of MZMs are reported in ironbased superconductors, such as FeTe0.55Se0.45 [50–52], (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFeSe [53], LiFeAs [54], and CaKFe4As4 [55], as well as the Majorana vortex states in iron-based superconducting nanowires [56], and MZM are also reported in atomically Fe-based Yu-Shiba-Rusinov chains [57–59], which provide new materials for creating Ising type topological quantum computer [60].
The MZMs in FQHE with ν = 5/2 and Kitaev’s model are closely related to the vortex bound states and chi-

2
ral Majorana edge modes (χMEMs) in the p-wave superconductor [61]. The interior of a vortex can be regarded as vacuum with a χMEM moving along the edge of the vortex, and when the radius of the vortex goes to zero, the χMEM reduces to the MZM, i.e., this provides a duality between MZM and MEM. Therefore, the p-wave topological superconductor is an important candidate for realizing the TQC. Although the material realization of the p-wave superconductor has not been found yet, for example, Sr2RuO4, which remains controversial [62, 63], the materials with eﬀective p-wave superconductivity are possible to construct. One possible scenario is by using the s-wave superconductor/quantum anomalous Hall heterostructure, and the proximity eﬀect will induce a chiral topological superconducting (χTSC) phase [64, 65]. Furthermore, the braiding of the MEMs are carried automatically when propagating along the edge, and the e2/2h conductance is believed to be a smoking gun signal for the existence of MEM [65]. Unfortunately, the experimental evidences of this scenario remain controversial [68–70]. The reason is that in this heterostructure, there can be residual metallic states in the quantum anomalous Hall substrate, which can also explain the half quantized conductance [69]. And the MZMs in the vortices of the superconducting area will dramatically change the results of the braiding [71, 72].
We have brieﬂy review the recent progresses in the TQC, especially for those based on Majorana objects. For more recent subject review, see [73]. We can classify these Majorana-based TQC proposals into two approaches to the non-Abelian statistics: (1) For one species Majorana fermion system, the many-particle wave functions of Majorana fermions obey the Abelian statistics. Other degrees of freedom such as the vortices must exist to have non-Abelian statistics, e.g, in the ν = 5/2 fractional quantum Hall states and the Ising model [24, 32] as well as the edge chiral vortices approach [74]. This kind of Majorana fermion systems can do the TQC but not universal by braiding solely. (2) For two species Majorana fermion model which is we consider here, no further degrees of freedom such as vortices are necessary. The two species Majorana fermions may be non-Abelian when the fermion number conservation is reduced to the fermion parity (FP) conservation, e.g., in superconductors. This approach has been used in [31– 34, 64, 65]. This kind of Majorana fermion systems also cannot be used to do universal quantum computation by braiding solely. In Appendix A, we give more explanations to these two approaches for readers’ convenience.
B. The Goal and Main Results of This Work
We already know that there are TQC processes with two types of non-Abelian anyons. The Fibonacci anyonbased one is universal but restricted by realistic materials. The algorithm is also diﬀerent from the conventional quantum circuit models. On the other hand, the Ma-

jorana fermion-based one is relevant to practical physical systems and the quantum circuit models, but is not universal by braiding solely. Furthermore, there should be no other low-energy fermionic or apparently even no bosonic states in the system to avoid the Majorana modes overlapping eﬀectively, which is another obstacle for Majorana fermion-based TQC [66, 67]. The main goal of this article is to design quantum gates for the universal TQC consistent with the quantum models, which combines the advantages of the χMEMs and the Fibonaccitype anyons.
In a recent work concerns Fibonacci topological superconductor [1], the authors showed that, in 7-layers of χTSC, the interacting χMEMs γa (a = 1, ..., 7) whose conformal dimension is 21 may be thought as composite objects: γa = τaεa where τ is the Fibonacci anyon with the conformal dimension 25 and ε is a thermal operator with the conformal dimension 110 in the tricritical Ising (TCI) model. The validity of such a composition is guaranteed by the coset factorization of the conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT): SO(7)1 = (G2)1× TCI [75]. (For readers’ convenience, we brieﬂy list the basic facts of G2 in Appendix B.)
The components of the MEMs can be delocalized when two MEMs with opposite chirality interact through a special interacting potential [1]. We here will analyze this interaction and show that it can be expressed as the interacting potential between charged fermions which consist of the MEMs when they meet in the interacting domains. Furthermore, the interaction between two propagating MEMs yields the collisions of either two τ or two ε. When the collided τ and ε are recombined, the braidings of anyons are achieved, similar to the Laughlin anyons collision [76].
With these anyons and their braidings, we obtain:
(1) These braidings cause the fractional statistical angles θ and then give the topological θ-phase gates with θ = π4 , 1π0 and 25π . With the π4 -phase gate and the braiding gate by braiding two MEMs in diﬀerent pairs of the χMEMs [65], the Pauli-X, Y, Z gates, the H gate, and the CNOT gate can be created. The other two phase gates, the 1π0 - and 25π -phase gates, which are topological, can replace the π8 -phase gate. With the similar method in [78], we prove that all these gates form a set of universal gates. We then can design a universal TQC with quantum circuit model [79].
(2) We ﬁnd that encoding quantum information and reading out the computation results can be carried out through electric signals.
(3) The quantum gates are generally dependent on the FP, the even or odd of the fermion number of the quantum state in the process, which is conserved and then determined by the initial qubits. For example, for a device set up by ﬁxed physical elements of a phase gate, the 1-qubit initial state with odd FP gives a phase gate diag(1, i) while it is diag(-i, 1) for even FP. A device gives

3
the CNOT gate if the 2-qubits are of an odd FP but it does not give a CNOT for the FP even qubits and vice verse, which is discussed in more details.
(4) Therefore, for a given physical device, side measurements are needed in order to have the input state with correct FP for the designed gate. The side measurement requires additional MEMs besides those in the computing state space. It is known that to encode the Majorana-based n logic qubits, 2n + 2 Majorana bound states or MEMs are needed [32]. However, with the side measurements, 4n MEMs are required to encode the nqubits [80]. The former is usually called the dense encoding process while the latter is the sparse encoding one [80]. Using the dense encoding only is not convenient to build a quantum circuit which is applied to well-known quantum algorithms, e.g., the quantum Fourier transformation and Shor’s integer factorization algorithm. Thus, the sparse encoding will be used to build our quantum circuit. However, in the sparse encoding, one can only prepare qubits in superposition states, but no entanglement states with braiding only [81]. For instance, with the sparse encoding, we cannot realize the CNOT gate from two 1-qubits. It has to be realized in the dense encoding. Thus, our process is a mixed one with the sparse-dense encodings. Notice that because of the no entanglement rule, the FP measurements are needed. Therefore, our CNOT gate is still probabilistic, although the eﬃciency is improved.
Using this process, we may realize a quantum circuit for Shor’s algorithm. Since there is one-to-one correspondence between the quantum gates and the designed devices with the χTSC thin ﬁlms, we can design a universal TQC for the large integer primary factorization.
C. Paper’s Organization
This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we review a 7-layer TSC system and the corresponding conformal ﬁeld theory properties. In Sec. III, we study the interaction between the right- and left-χMEMs (R, L-χMEMs) when they meet. In Sec. IV, we show the anyon exchange and braiding due to the interaction between the χMEMs. In Sec. V, we construct a set of universal topological gates which are used to encode a universal TQC. The corresponding physical devices are designed. In Sec. VI, we show that the computing results can be output by electric signals. In Sec. VII, we use these quantum gates to build the quantum circuit with the sparse-dense mixed encoding. We apply these designations to the quantum Fourier transformation, Toﬀoli gate which is the key element for an adder, and then the quantum circuit for Shor’s algorithm. In Sec. VIII, we give the device designation of the quantum circuits by using the elements of the quantum gates which consist of the thin ﬁlms of the χTSC and the interacting domains of the MEMs. The last section devotes to our conclusions. We have six appendices to support the results obtained in the main

II. MULTILAYER χTSC SYSTEMS

We consider multilayers of χTSC which are separated
layer-by-layer by the trivial insulator. Spinless or spin
polarized charged fermions are injected into the edges of
the multilayers and each edge fermion is decomposed into two MEMs with diﬀerent species: ψ = √1 (γ(1) + iγ(2))
2
(See Appendix A). Depending on the multilayer assign-
ment, we label γa the MEM into the ath layer. We do not explicitly index the species of the MEM because each
of them freely runs in its own layer edge. Thus, a χMEM
on the edge of each layer is spatially separated from the
other χMEMs. We denote the edge coordinate as x. The free χMEMs γaR,L(x) on the edges of an individual layer is described by the Hamiltonian

HaR,L = ± i2v γaR,L ∂∂x γaR,L, (1)

where ± are corresponding to the right (R)- and lef t (L)-

chirality. The N -layer χMEMs are described by the

SO(N )1 CFT [1]. The fermion number N of the system

is not conserved but the even and odd of the fermion

number, i.e., the FP (−1)N , is conserved.

For our purpose, we take N = 7. It is known that

if there are appropriate interactions between the MEMs

(see below and Appendix C), the SO(7)1 CFT can be fac-

torized by the coset SO(7)1/(G2)1. The central charge

of the Wess-Zumino-Witten models of a level k aﬃne Lie

group

G

is

given

by

cG

=

k dimg k+g

where

dimg

is

the

dimen-

sion of the Lie algebra and g is the dual Coxeter number.

For

SO(7)1,

c

=

21 1+5

=

7 2

while

c

=

14 1+4

=

14 5

for

(G2)1.

Therefore, the central charge of the coset SO(7)1/(G2)1 is 27 − 154 = 170 . This means that the CFT of the WessZumino-Witten model of the coset SO(7)1/(G2)1 is noth-

ing but the TCI model [75]. The (G2)1 CFT has one

type of anyon: Fibonacci τ with the conformal dimen-

sion hτ

=

2 5

while the SO(7)1/(G2)1

CFT is equiva-

lent to the TCI model where non-Abelian anyons, the

thermal operators ε and ε have the conformal dimen-

sions

hε

=

1 10

and

hε

= 35 , respectively [75].

These

non-Abelian anyons have th√e same quantum dimensions,

i.e., dτ = dε = dε = 1+2 5 . Thus, as we have men-

tioned in Introduction, the MEMs can be decomposed

into γa = τaεa in terms of the coset construction due to

the adaptation of the conformal dimensions.

III. INTERACTION BETWEEN R- AND L-χMEMS FOR 7-LAYERS
Formally, the seven free χMEMs Hamiltonian HR,L = 7a=1 HaR,L can be decomposed into HGR2,L + HTRC,LI . The explicit expressions of HGR2,L and HTRC,LI can be found in [1] and are not important here, but we know that

4

[HTRC,LI , JRα,L] = 0 where the current operators JRα,L (α =

1, ..., 14)

are

deﬁned

by

JRα,L

=

1 2

a,b ΞαabγaR,LγbR,L for

Ξα being the generators of the fundamental representa-

tion of G2. Following Ref. [1], we consider the interaction

between the R- and L-χMEMs as

14

Hi = −λ JRαJLα.

(2)

α=1

Using the quadratic Casimir operator of G2 (see Eq. (B3)), Hi is rewritten as [1]

Hi = − λ3 γaRγbRγbLγaL − λ3 γaRγbRγcLγdL, (3)
a=b

where means the summation runs over the indices
with abcdefgfˆefg = −1 (see Appendix B). If any two
MEMs with diﬀerent species but the same chirality meet, they become a local charged fermion, say, ψaRb = 21 (γaR(1) + iγbR(2)) and ψaLb = 12 (γaL(1) + iγbL(2)) in Fig. 1 (e). Since iγaR(1)γbR(2) = 2nRab − 1 = 2n˜Rab with the fermion number operator nRab = ψaRb†ψaRb, for λ > 0, the interaction Hamiltonian becomes the interactions with a
particle-hole symmetry between the charged fermions

Hi = U n˜Rabn˜Lba + U n˜Rabn˜Lcd,

(4)

a=b

where U = 43λ . If two MEMs with diﬀerent species and chirality meet (Fig. 1(f)), the Hamiltonian can be expressed as

Hi = U n˜RaaLn˜RbbL + U n˜RadLn˜RbcL,

(5)

a=b

where

n˜RadL

=

nRadL −

1 2

for

the

fermion

number

operator

nRadL = ψaRdL†ψaRdL with ψaRdL = 12 (γaR(1) + iγdL(2)), and so on. Therefore, it is possible to realize the interactions,

e.g., by introducing four narrow stripes of the χTSC

sample from the edges of the thin ﬁlms to a domain

where the MEMs interact (See Appendix C). In reality,

the coupling constant λ may be dependent on the do-

mains. But if the strengths of these coupling constants

are of the same order, these diﬀerences are not relevant

at the strong coupling ﬁxed point. The τ -anyon in the

domain gains an energy gap ∆ ∼ e−πv/2λ for λ > 0

[1]. This means that in the strong coupling region (see

the green box in Figs. 1(a,b)), τ are reﬂected by this

interaction potential while ε are transmitted. In this

sense, the composite MEMs in the interacting domains

are decomposed into spatially separated τ and ε. Notice

that the interactions γaRγbRγbLγdL with a = b = d, etc will gap ε. Therefore, when introducing the MEMs

to the interacting domains, one must avoid this type

of interactions. The FP is also conserved after the

interaction is switched on.

5

IV. ANYON BRAIDING

In Fig. 1 (a) and (b), we depict two ways that a R-χMEM and a L-χMEM propagate to the interacting domain. In both cases, εR,L are transmitted while τR,L are reﬂected by the interacting potential, but τR and τL exchange in Fig. 1 (a) while εR,L exchange in Fig. 1(b). These anyon exchanges give rises the fractional statistics by braiding the anyons [76]. The world lines of the corresponding anyon braidings are showed in Fig. 1 (c) and (d), respectively. The reason for why there are two types of collisions can be traced to the fact that we have two ways to write the four-Majorana fermion interaction in Eq. (4). Figs. 1 (e) and (g) are the examples of the interacting processes corresponding to τ ’s braiding while Figs. 1 (f) and (h) are to ε’s braiding.
For a CFT, the four-point correction function corresponding to the anyons collision can be calculated if we assume the τ is reﬂected with a ratio r ∼ 1 − e−∆/T and the ε is fully transmitted according to the interaction Eq. (2). By a Wick rotation y → it, the collision matrices for Fig. 1 can be determined by the following 8-point Green’s function

with zaτ → zaε for z = x+iy because of the coset decomposition of SO(7)1 CFT. The 4-point correlation function of a primary ﬁeld φ in the CFT can be exactly calculated
[77]

φ(z1)φ(z2)φ(z3)φ(z4) = F (x)(z12z13z14z23z24z34)−2h/3,(6)

where zij = zi − zj and x = zz1132zz2344 . The function F (x) can be determined by the Ward identities of the CFT. Exchanging any two φ ﬁelds, we have a statistical phase e2ihπ (where we have taken e−iπ = −1 for convenience). Wick rotating back, braiding τ or ε obtains a statistical phase e4iπ/5 or eiπ/5. In the following we assume τ is completely reﬂected while ε is fully transmitted. In reality, the ﬁnite temperature will cause an error with probability proportional to e−∆/T in τ collision while the interaction deviating from (2) can cause the error both for τ and ε collisions.
We now want to design the topological phase elements. Fig. 2 (a) is the schematics of the elements G(θ) = e−2iθ. Fig. 2 (e) is the top view of Fig. 2 (a) when the two interacting domains are diﬀerent (The other two cases are shown in Appendix D). A charged spinless fermion ψ is injected from the lead to the 2-layer χTSC such that ψ → √12 (γ1 + iγ2) where the χMEMs γ1,2 run along the edges of layer 1 and 2, respectively. They then become the R and L-χMEMs and enter one of the edge channels in 7-layers with an equal probability. The MEMs are factorized into anyons: γ1,2 = τ1,2ε1,2. In the yellow interacting domain, anyons, say τ from Fig. 2 (e),

collide. This yields the braiding of τ . After the ﬁrst

collision, anyons run into the next 1-2-7 layer hybrid

and collide in the purple domain. As a result, e.g., ε

anyons braid. According to the anyon’s conformal di-

mensions, the braiding of them causes statistical phases:

on.

V. UNIVERSAL SET OF TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM GATES
We now design a new set of topological quantum gates with these topological elements. Due to the FP conservation, the Hilbert space with a ﬁxed FP for a single charged fermion is one-dimensional and then cannot encode a qubit. To construct a 1-qubit with a ﬁxed FP, two charged fermion are required.
A. The Basic Braiding gates and Hadamard Gate for 1-Qubit
We consider charged fermions inject into the edges of two layer χTSC thin ﬁlms from leads in the terminals A and B (Fig. 3). The initial states are then |nAnB for nA,B = 0, 1 corresponding to the FP even and odd. If we consider weak current limit, we assume nA,B = 0, 1 are the fermion number and the state |1A = ψA|0 = √12 (γ1 + iγ2)|0 and |1B = ψB|0 = √12 (γ3 + iγ4)|0 . The basis of the initial state space is then given by
{|0γA1γ2 0γB3γ4 , |0γA1γ2 1γB3γ4 , |1γA1γ2 0γB3γ4 , |1γA1γ2 1γB3γ4 }.
The ﬁrst and fourth ones form 1-qubit with the FP even while the other 1-qubit has the FP odd. We now braid two of MEMS while keeping the other two run straightforwardly. The basis of the ﬁnal state spaces are transformed as
{|0γC2γ1 0γD3γ4 , |0γC2γ1 1γD3γ4 , |1γC2γ1 0γD3γ4 , |1γC2γ1 1γD3γ4 },

which correspond to braiding (γ1, γ2), (γ2, γ3), and (γ3, γ4), respectively. For a ﬁxed FP, there are braiding matrices which transform the initial states to the ﬁnal
states, e.g., the braiding matrix for braiding γ2 and γ3 for the FP odd state is given by

|0γCγ1γγ3 1γDγ2γγ4 = B(−) |0γAγ1γγ2 1γBγ3γγ4 . (9)

And also we can deﬁne all Ba(±b ) for a < b = 1, ..., 4, where ± stands for the FP of the qubit. Lian et al. gave a proposal for the gate B2(−3 ) with a quantum anomalous Hall insulator/superconductor proximity structure [65].
We here use the layered χTSC structure for B2(−3 ) (Fig. 3(a)). As shown in Fig. 3(b), in the edges of the upper
layer, γ1 runs from A to C while γ4 from B to D while in the edges of the lower layer, γ2 runs from A to D while γ3 from B to C. This yields the braiding between γ2 and γ3 (Fig. 3(c)). Under a braiding operation γ2 → γ3, γ3 → −γ2, the evolution of the FP odd state is thus equivalent

B2(−3 ) = √12 1i 1i . (10)

One can also show that B2(+3 ) = B2(−3 ) ≡ B23 which is FP-independent. Exchanging γ1 and γ2 can be simply
realized by adding a phase gate on the upper edge of the double layer thin ﬁlms in Fig. 3 (d) with G(θ) = G(− π4 ). The corresponding phase gates B1(±2 ) are also the same, i.e., B12 = diag(1, i), which is the π4 -phase gate. The braiding matrix B34, which is realized by adding G(− π4 ) on the lower edge instead of adding it on the upper edge in Fig. 3 (d). However, we ﬁnd that B3(−4 ) is not the same as B3(+4 ) because B3(+4 ) = diag(1, i) while B3(−4 ) = diag(i, 1).
With these basic braiding matrices, we can make the
Hadamard gate, up to a global phase i,

.

(11)

And also H ∼ B3(−4 )B23B3(−4 ) ∼ B3(+4 )3B23B3(+4 )3 up to a sign. Therefore, the Hadamard gate is also FPindependent when the basis for 1-qubit is properly chosen. Furthermore, we have Z = B122, X = HZH and Y = (ZH)2. Up to a global phase, they all are independent of the FP. In this way, we have a set of FPindependent Cliﬀord gates.
In general, Fig. 3 (d) gives a phase gate B(θ/2) = diag(1, G(−θ)) ∼ diag(G(θ/2), G(−θ/2)). The topological phase gates through anyon braiding are B(− 1π0 ), B(− 25π ) as well as B( 1π0 ) = B9(− 1π0 ) = B−1(− 1π0 ), and so on. They are independent of the FP of the 1-qubit.

B. The CNOT Gate

To achieve universal TQC, we design a CNOT gate for 2-qubits using six χMEMs γ1, ..., γ6. The setup of the CNOT gate is FP-dependent. We ﬁrst take the basis with even total FP as an example, i.e., the incoming basis
(|0A0B0C , |0A1B1C , |1A0B1C , |1A1B0C )T (12)

and the outgoing basis (|0D0E0F , |0D1E1F , |1D0E1F , |1D1E0F )T . (13)

The device is shown in Fig. 4 (a) and its top view in

Fig. 4(b).

If we use the elements Ga(θa) with θ1 =

π 4

and θ2,3,4,5 = − π4 , the braiding matrices for 2-qubits are

B1(22) = diag(1, 1, i, i), B3(24) = diag(1, i, 1, i), and B5(26) =

diag(1, i, i, 1) (See Fig. 4(c)). B4(25) in Fig. 4(c) is the 2-

qubits counterpart of the B23 gate,

i 1 0 0
B4(25) = √12  10 0i 0i 01  001 i

where the subscripts stand for the relative positions of the γs at a given time slice. According to the sequence of the B-matrices in Fig. 4(c), we obtain the CNOT gate

CNOT(+) = B4(25)B3(24)B5(26)B4(25)B5(26)B3(24)B1(22)−1

C. Universal Topological Quantum Gates
The authors of Ref. [78] proved the universality of the quantum circuit models which is equivalent to Ref.

[79]. They chose three gates {H, Z 41 = B( π8 ), CNOT} as their universal set. In their proof, the key essence is that they can create two orthogonal axes and a phase with irrational number times π from the universal set, namely, any element in SU(2) can be approximated in a desired precision. Here we will show the existence of the orthogonal axes and the irrational number for strongly correlated Majorana fermion based the TQC. √
The universal set that we choose is {H, Z = B( π4 ), B(− 1π0 ), CNOT}. They all have been obtained in last two subsections. Therefore, our universal set is topo-

8

logical and fault-tolerant. Similar to those in [78], we use

nˆ2 ≈ (0.309017, 0.0908178, 0.279508).
Clearly, nˆ1 · nˆ2 = 0. Furthermore, ei2λπ is the noncyclotomic root of the irreducible monic polynomial equation x4 + x3/4 + x2/16 + x/4 + 1 = 0. Hence, λ is irrational. If constructing a local isomorphism from SU(2) to SO(3), then any element of SU(2) can be expressed as an Euler rotation. That is, if α, β and γ are the Euler angles, any elements of SU(2) can be written as [87] eiφnˆ·X = eiαnˆ1·X eiβnˆ2·X eiγnˆ1·X . Because λ is irrational, there are a, b and c such that α ≈ aλπ, β ≈ bλπ and γ ≈ cλπ, i.e.,

eiφnˆ·X ≈ (U1)a(U2)b(U1)c,

(22)

where a, b and c are integers determined by α, β, and γ in a desired p√recision. This gives the proof of the universality of {H, Z = B( π4 ), B(− 1π0 ), CNOT} according to [79].

VI. ELECTRIC SIGNALS OF THE OUTPUTS
Since the initial and ﬁnal states are the charged fermions, the inputs and readout of the designed TQC

are electric. To read out the computation results of the

TQC, we must translate the outgoing states of the quan-

tum gate operations into electric signals.

For the ZH gate, the conductance between the leads

at the two ends of the device measures the operating

result [65]. For the other 1-qubit gates, the conduc-

tance calculation is also direct. Here, we give an ex-

ample for the 2-qubits, the CNOT gate. The incoming

and outgoing bases are given by (12) and (13), respec-

tively. The FP 0 or 1 can be read out by the electric

signals at the leads. The CNOT gate changes |1A0B1C to |1A1B0C and vise versa, while keeping |0A0B0C and |0A1B1C unchanged. Thus, these states changes can be read out from the conductance between Lead 2 and Lead 3: σ23 = (1 − ψout|ψin ) eh2 . Namely, σ23 = e2/h for |ψin = |1A0B1C or |1A1B0C while σ23 = 0 for |ψin = |0A0B0C or |0A1B1C .

If the phases in Ga(θa) in Fig. 4 are arbitrary, the outgoing state |ψout is given by |ψout = U (θa)|ψin where |ψin is the incoming state and U (θa) is the unitary transformation (See Appendix E). For example, for an incom-

ing state |ψin = |0A0B0C , the outgoing state is |ψf =

1 2

(1

e−iθ5

)|0A0B

0C

+ 21 [ie−iθ12 (1 + e−iθ5 )]|0A1B 1C

and the corresponding conductance is σ23 = cos2(θ5) eh2 .

For the topological CNOT gate, these Ga(θa) are given

by the device in θ2 = θ3 = θ4 = θ5 = − π4 and θ1 = π4 ,

and σ23 exactly gives the result we analyzed before.

Before ending this section, we would like to discuss the

spin polarization problem. We assume the px +ipy χTSC is a spinless fermion system. In reality, it should be a spin

polarized system. First we would like to emphasize that

a calculating unit, i.e., the quantum circuit, must be in

connection to one bulk of TSC in order to prevent the

phase loss of the phase gates. Therefore, the spin of the

Cooper pairs in the circuit is all of the same polarization and so the spin of the chiral edge states is. A real spin polarized χTSC material is not yet ready in nature. If it was found, the Cooper pair’s spin would be ﬁxed by the materials. The electron’s spin from Leads to the edge of TSC will be automatically selected by the TSC. A better choice is using spin selecting valve, e.g., injecting in and putting out the electrons from a ferromagnet [82], anomalous Rashba metal/superconductor junctions [83] or in noncollinear antiferromagnets [84], in order to prevent the opposing spin electrons aﬀect the data read in and out. In these cases, a gap opens between the spin majority electron and spin minority electron near the Fermi level. The conversion losses mainly depend on the mismatch of Fermi velocities, the polarizability, and the energy of electronics. Lower mismatch of Fermi velocities and higher polarizability are expected to get fewer losses.
VII. THE QUANTUM CIRCUITS WITH TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM GATES
We have constructed a set of universal quantum gates for 1-qubit and the CNOT gate. In principle, we can use them to construct the quantum circuit models associated with quantum algorithms, e.g., the quantum Fourier transformation, a classical adder with quantum gates, and then Shor’s integer factorization algorithm. However, the conventional TQC process with non-Abelian anyon does not follow the quantum circuit models. In the former, a larger qubit gate is not simply constructed by the smaller gates. Our CNOT gate construction is an example because it is not assembled by two 1-qubit gates. In fact, an n-gate in this quantum computation uses 2n + 2 MEMs (Fig. 5 (a)). This is called the ‘dense encoding’ process [80]. With the quantum circuit model, an n-gate is constructed by 4n MEMs (Fig. 5 (b)). This process matches with the quantum circuit model and is called the ‘sparse encoding’ process [80]. In order to encode Shor’s algorithm, we take the sparse encoding. Since the set of universal quantum gates for the 1-qubit is not dependent on the FP of the 1-qubit, they are good elements for the quantum circuit. However, in the sparse encoding, one can only prepare qubits in superposition states, but no entanglement states with braiding only [81]. For instance, we cannot make the CNOT gate with two gates for 1-qubit. It has to be realized in the dense encoding as we have shown. Therefore, our process in fact is a mixed one of the sparse-dense encoding. We use six MEMs to construct a CNOT gate. This does not match the quantum circuit model. On the other hand, the CNOT gate we constructed in Sec. V B is dependent on the FP of the 2-qubits. To measure the FP of the 2-qubits, two additional ancillary MEMs are required. This makes a CNOT gate with eight MEMs in the sparse encoding. Adding this sparse encoding CNOT gate to the universal gates for 1-qubit, we can make a quantum

9
circuit as usual. To illustrate such a process, we show the quantum cir-
cuit with our TQC process for Shor’s integer factorization algorithm.

FIG. 5: (Color online) Two diﬀerent encodings [80].(a) The dense encoding process using 2n + 2 MEMs to encode nqubits;(b) The sparse encoding, n-qubits are encoded by 4n MEMs.

A. The CNOT Gate in Sparse Encoding

We construct the CNOT gate in the sparse encoding.

As we mentioned, two ancillary MEMs will be introduced

to measure the FP of the 2-qubits. Notice that the mea-

surements here do not measure the fermion occupation

number of the computational states directly, but measure the parity operator Pˆ = iγ1γ2... which won’t destroy the

coherence of the quantum state. In experiment, we make

a side measurement to the total charge or the total spin for the subsystem to determine the eigenvalue of Pˆ [86].

More speciﬁcally, we want to measure the FP of 2-

qubits that are input into a CNOT(+) given by Eq. (14).

In the sparse encoding, 2-qubits are associated with 4

pairs MEMs γ1, γ2, ..., γ8, we use the same process taken

in Ref. [80], i.e., we enforce γ1γ2γ3γ4 = γ5γ6γ7γ8 = +1

(or −1). We take γ4,5 as an ancillary qubit and measure

its FP, i.e., iγ4γ5 (Fig. 6). Thus, γ6 exchanges with γ4,5

and forms a new pair with γ3.

If iγ4γ5 = 1 (or −1), the remaining six MEMs form 2-

qubits in the dense encoding with even FP. We then use

the 2-qubits as the input state to a CNOT(+) given by Eq.

(14), according to the selected parity of the CNOT(+)

(See Fig. 6). Otherwise, we do the measurement again

until iγ4γ5 = 1 (or −1). Finally, we add γ4,5 back and

exchange γ6 with γ4,5 again, then measure γ5γ6γ7γ8. If it

is 1 (or −1), the eight MEMs return to a 2-qubits with the

positive FP in the sparse encoding which is the output

state (Fig. 6). In this way, we encode the CNOT gate

with the sparse encoding. For more details, see Appendix

F.

We can improve the eﬃciency in inputing. After mak-

ing the measurement M1, we can switch θ1 from − π4 to

π 4

and

θ3,5

from

− π4

to

π 4

if

iγ4γ5

= −1(or

1)

as

we

will

see in Sec. VIII. In this case, the CNOT(+) gate becomes

the CNOT(−). Thus, instead of abandoning the FP neg-

ative state, it can be used. We next add back γ4,5 and

do the similar operations to return the 2-qubits in the

sparse encoding as before. Furthermore, we can further

improve the eﬃciency if the FP measurement in M2 is

wrong by correcting FP, which will not be studied here.

FIG. 6: (Color online) The CNOT in sparse encoding with even parity. The blue shade area is the same as the dense encoding CNOT(+) (Fig. 4 (c)). Because of the noentanglement rule, two FP measurements are needed to get the entanglement states.

B. Brief Introduction of Shor’s Algorithm

In the coming several subsections, we describe Shor’s

integer factorization algorithm with our TQC process.

We ﬁrst give a brief introduction to Shor’s algorithm [88].

The key step of Shor’s algorithm is turning the in-

teger factorization problem to a period-ﬁnding problem

and then uses quantum computer to realize a period-

ﬁnding subroutine, i.e., to ﬁnd the period r of the function f (x) = axmodN , where N is the integer waiting

to be factorized and a is an arbitrary number that is

coprime with N . Calculating the greatest common di-

visors

and

),

then

N = n1 · n2, which can be realized by Euclid’s algorithm

classically.

We denote the basis of a 1-qubit with a given FP, e.g., {|0γ1γ2 1γ3γ4 , |1γ1γ2 0γ3γ4 } as {|0 , |1 }. Starting from two registers in which Register 1 = |0l which is the product of l |0 and Register 2= |0q . The quantum part of

Shor’s algorithm, the period-ﬁnding subroutine, is com-

posed by three steps [88]: (i) Doing the quantum Fourier transformation to Register 1 with 2q = N , n = 2l is a number within (N 2, 2N 2)

we obtain a random number y. Repeat the process again, we have a new y. The maximal one in a series of y is the period r.
Fig. 7 is the schematic of Shor’s period-ﬁnding algorithm. In the following we explain the detailed algorithms for the quantum Fourier transformation and the modular exponentiation with our quantum circuit model.

FIG. 7: The period-ﬁnding subroutine. It is composed by three steps: Do the quantum Fourier transformation (FT) to Register 1; apply the modular exponentiation Uf and measure Register 2 such that the state in Register 1 collapses. Do the quantum Fourier transformation to Register 1 again. Finally, measure the output state in Register 1.

C. Quantum Fourier Transformation

Quantum Fourier transformation is the quantum ana-

logue of the discrete Fourier transformation, which plays

an important role in many quantum algorithms [88].

The circuit implementation is shown in Fig. 8. It con-

sists of the Hadamard gate and the controlled-phase gate

FIG. 8: The circuit implementation for quantum Fourier transformation.

The controlled-phase gate is a two-qubit gate, i.e., the target qubit is acted by a phase gate,

Controlled-gates are a kind of gates often used in quantum computation and are proven to be decomposed into

the combination of CNOT and 1-qubit gates [79]. In case
of the controlled-Bn, one of the decomposition methods is given by Fig. 9, i.e., the controlled-Bn is composed by the 1-qubit gate Bn+1,

Bn+1 =

e−iπ/2n+1 0

(26)

FIG. 10: The construction of adder. |ai and |bi are the ith qubit of Register 1 and Register 2, respectively. |ci represents the ith qubit of the ancillary register to carry the calculation.

FIG. 9: The decomposition of the controlled-Bn.
We see that Bn+1 is a group element of SU(2). For example, for the controlled-B2 gate (B2 is often called the S gate or π4 -gate), B( π8 ) (also called the π8 -phase gate or T -gate) is needed. As we have shown, it can be approximated by Eq. (22). When a = 18, b = 22 and c = 17, Eq. (22) gives the T -gate in a precision > 97%.
Any 1-qubit quantum gate can be approximated by Eq. (22) and a rough calculation can estimate the circuit scale. Suppose a quantum gate within the accuracy range σ is needed. This is equivalent to move a vector A on a Bloch sphere to a designated point by rotating about two orthogonal axes M = a + b + c times successively. M operations will give a total of 16 (M + 1)(M + 2)(M + 3) diﬀerent points on the Bloch sphere. It requires that these points can cover the sphere. Deﬁning the accuracy requirement as the solid angle range of the vector neighborhood, then 16 (M + 1)(M + 2)(M + 3) · σ ∼ 4π. With the accuracy requirement σ, it takes about M ∼ 3 24σπ steps to get the desired quantum gate. This argument, however, doesn’t depend on the speciﬁc gate, but only related to the accuracy, is an estimate of the upper limit. For some special gate, much less operations are required.

Fig. 11 shows one of constructions for the Toﬀoli gate, where CCZ = diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, −1) and H3 = H ⊗ H ⊗ H with the Hadamard gate acting on the diﬀerent 1-qubit.
FIG. 11: The constructions for Toﬀoli gate and CCZ.
We draw the complete logical circuit for Toﬀoli gate in Fig. 12 (a). And then Fig. 12 (b) gives the braiding diagram with MEMs for the Toﬀoli gate. Notice that some quantum gates may act on two qubits which are not neighboring but jumping is not allowed in the TQC. One has to move them together ﬁrst. The operator Uˆ1 and Uˆ2 are composed by the Hadamard gate and diﬀerent phase gates (see Section V C). Fig. 12(d) shows the braiding diagram for Uˆ1 as an example.

D. Adder and Toﬀoli Gate
As we have seen, the modular exponentiation applies following transformation
Uf |x ⊗ |0q → |x ⊗ |axmodN ,
where |x and |0q represent two registers and the Uf is determined by a and N . The elementary block for a computer to realize basic arithmetic operations is the addition unit or called an adder. Starting from the adder, Vedral et al. provide an explicit construction of quantum circuit to realize modular exponentiation [89]. A plain adder is constructed in Fig. 10, which consists of the CNOT gates and the Toﬀoli gates.
The Toﬀoli gate is controlled-controlled-NOT and can be decomposed as
Toﬀoli = CCX = H3 · CCZ · H3.

gap. With the basic elements, the Hadamard gate can be
constructed as Fig. 14. The yellow stickers are the phase gates.

Figs. 3 (a,b,d) and 4 (a,b) are the schematics of the devices for 1-qubit and 2-qubits. Logically, these designed devices are equivalent to their corresponding world line graphs, i.e., Figs. 3 (d) and 4 (c). If we only measure these 1- or 2- qubits, we can use these devices. However, the devices designed in those schematics cannot be used as parts in the quantum circuit because the twodimensional projects of the devices are topologically different from the world line graphs, which is easy to see by comparing Fig. 3 (b) with (c), and Fig. 4 (b) with (c). Therefore, we change the designation of the devices in three dimensions such that they are adaptive with the world line graphs and then can be used to assemble the quantum circuit.
We ﬁrst deform Fig. 3 (a) for B23 to Fig. 13 (a) where the blue layer is the χTSC and the gray layer is dielectric substrate as before. The second and the third χTSC layers are connected by a vertical χTSC slide and are corresponding to the N = 1 base layer in Fig. 3 (a). The top and down layers are corresponding to the two top layers on the right and left hand sides in Fig. 3 (a). The MEMs will run along the edges of χTSC and we see the braiding between γ2,3. Fig. 13 (b) are right view of (a). The front view of Fig. 13 (a) maps out the world line (Fig. 13). The matrix B23 in (10) is not equal to its inverse. The inverse B2−31 is shown in Fig. 13 (d). Its right and front views (Figs. 13 (e) and (f)) indeed show that is an inverse operation.

B. CNOT Gate

Fig. 15 shows the CNOT gate in the dense encoding

and will be encapsulated together with two parity mea-

surements corresponding to a logical CNOT gate as Fig.

6. In practical computation processes, if the whole cir-

cuit owns n CNOT gates, we only keep the result that Pˆ1 = Pˆ2 = ... = Pˆ2n = 1 (or -1, depending on the se-

lected FP). The probability of getting the useful results

is

1 42n

.

However,

the

speed

that

a

quantum

state

runs

is

Fermi velocity vF which is ∼ 10−3c. If the device size

is in the order of microns, we can input 1011 quantum

states per second.

As we mentioned in Sec. VII A, we can alternatively

choose to switch the CNOT(+) to the CNOT(−) after

we get iγ4γ5 = −1 in M1. The probability may in-

crease

to

1 22n

.

It is more eﬃcient.

The switching be-

tween G(± π4 ) and G(∓ π4 ) is operable because G( π4 ) =

G(− π4 )G(− π4 )G(− π4 ). The switching can be done by con-

necting either one G(− π4 ) or three G(− π4 ) after receiving

the message in terms of M1.

To further raise the inputing eﬃciency is possible in-

stead of abandoning the wrong FP state measured in M2.

Some diﬀerent process for measurement-based CNOT are

proposed [90]. Instead of abandoning useless messages,

they correct the quantum state according to the side mea-

surements. The cost is 6 pairs of MEMs are needed and

2 pairs of them are used to be ancillary and three side

measurements are made. We can also realize this kind of

measurement-based CNOT by the topological supercon-

ductor thin ﬁlms. The advantage is the inputing eﬃcient

may greatly lift. How to correct the abandoning message

in our algorithm is not studied here.

To be more intuitive, we make the upper layers translucent. The MEMs runs along the arrows in the edges of thin ﬁlms.
It is also possible to exchange γ2 and γ4. However, for a 1-qubit gate, the probability of such an exchange is negligible because the low-energy pairing between two incoming fermions is forbidden by the superconducting

IX. CONCLUSIONS
We proposed a new route to design a universal TQC. We showed that the universal TQC based on strongly corrected MEMs coincides with the conventional quantum circuit models. We have noticed that some quantum gates we designed are dependent on the FP of the input qubits. To construct the multi-qubits and the corresponding unitary transformation by braiding, we have used the sparse-dense mixed encoding process which is based on the FP side measurement to the ancillary qubits. We discussed the possibility to raise the inputing eﬃciency. We constructed a quantum circuit model for Shor’s algorithm with our devices. In general, our process can be applied to all existed and new quantum algorithms in study [91]. Without the FP measurement, we should follow the unitary category approach developed for the TQC [20]. In this work, we do not do a full dense encoding construction for a universal TQC with our devices, which is a next task. We here take the strong coupling limit in which τ are reﬂected while the ε are transmitted by interacting barrier. In reality, the reﬂection of anyons is not complete, but of a statistical correction as a recent experiment showed [76]. We will leave this eﬀect from the anyon collisions to the TQC in a further study. We showed that some quantum operating results can transfer to the electrical signs of the output states, e.g., the CONT gate’s in the dense encoding as well as the 1-qubit’s. However, for a quantum circuit, because we take the sparse encoding and there are the other complex conditions, we do not discuss its electric sign of the output. We will also study these issues in future.

We explain when the Majorana fermions are Abelian and when they are non-Abelian.
1. One Species of Majorana Fermions
Consider N -Majorana fermions which are of the same species, say, γ(xi), i = 1, ..., N , as in the ν = 5/2 FQHE and the Ising model [24]. Let us begin with the following Majorana fermion relations
γ(xi)γ(xj) = −γ(xj)γ(xi), if xi = xj γ(xi)γ(xj) = 1, if xi = xj.
The quantum states at a given spatial point x are |ψ+ ⊕ |ψ− where |ψ± have fermion parity ±. The fermion parity means whether the number of Majorana fermions is even or odd. The fusion rules are ψ+ψ+ = ψ+, ψ+ψ− = ψ−, ψ−ψ− = ψ+, i.e., one species of many Majorana fermions are Abelian.
To enable non-Abelian statistics, one needs to introduce other degrees of freedom, e.g., vortices. If there is a vortex excitation besides the Majorana fermions at a given x, i.e., a Majorana bound state, we have the basis
(|ψ+,0 , |ψ−,0 , |ψ+,1 , |ψ−,1 ) ∼= (I, ψ, σ, σ × ψ = µ). (A1)
where |ψp,a are the states with the fermion parity p = ± and the vortex number 0, 1. The right hand side of ∼= is the primary ﬁelds in the Ising model. According to the Ising model, the non-Abelian anyon is the Majorana bound state, 1 qubit, σ˜ = (σ + µ, σ − µ) which has the non-Abelian fusion rule σ˜ × σ˜ = I + ψ.
W√ith anyon σ˜, one can construct the quantum gates {H, Z, CN OT } and then TQC can be partially encoded.
2. Two Species of Majorana Fermions
Now, let us discuss two species of Majorana fermions, which is the case in the main text, where a spinless (or spin polarized) conventional fermion Ψ can be decomposed into two species of Majorana fermions Ψ(xi) = √12 (γ(1)(xi) + iγ(2)(xi)). Ψs’ anti-communication relations
{Ψ(xi), Ψ(xj)} = 0, {Ψ(xi), Ψ†(xj)} = δij

14

require
γ(1)(xi)γ(2)(xj ) = −γ(1)(xj )γ(2)(xi), f or any xi and xj γ(a)(xi)γ(a)(xj ) = −γ(a)(xj )γ(a)(xi), f or xi = xj γ(a)(xi)γ(a)(xj ) = 1, f or xi = xj

objects cannot used to design a TQC because there is no a topological CNOT in this scheme.
Appendix B: Basic facts of G2

Notice that two species of Majorana fermions are necessary to form a conventional (charged) fermion. If γ(1) ≡ γ(2), i.e., they were the same species Majorana fermion, one could not obtain the above commutators for the conventional fermion.
For the conventional fermion in the normal states, the the particle number is conserved. The single particle state is |φn for the particle number n = 0, 1. We have the the well-known Fermi statistics which is Abelian.
In a superconductor, the single particle number is no longer a conserved quantity as a pair of electrons can turn into a Cooper pair and vice versa. However, the fermion parity, i.e., the odd/even number of the single particles, is conserved since the single particles are created or annihilated in pairs. Furthermore, in the edges of multi-layer thin ﬁlms of a topological superconductor, two Majorana fermions from the injected conventional fermion can be delocalized to the edges of the diﬀerent ﬁlms (similar to two delocalized Majorana zero modes at the two ends of a Kitaev chain). Thus, the quantum states at a position x along the edge form the basis

Although Hu and Kane listed most of the useful con-

tents of G2 in their work [1], we would like to concisely re-

peat part of them for reader’s convenience. The simplest

exceptional Lie group G2 as a subgroup of SO(7) keeps

7 a,b,c=1

fˆabcγaγbγc

invariant.

We

choose

the

nonzero

to-

tal antisymmetric fˆabc to be [92]

fˆ124 = fˆ235 = fˆ346 = fˆ457 = fˆ561 = fˆ672 = fˆ713 = 1, (B1)

and the permutations. The 21 generators of SO(7) can be represented by 7 × 7 skew matrices Lm ab,n = i(δmaδnb − δnaδmb) where m < n = 1, ..., 7. The dimensions of G2 is 14 and the generators Ξα of the fundamental representa-
tion of G2 is given by [1, 93]

Ξα =

, Lα,α+2 −√Lα+1,α+5
2
, Lα,α+2 +Lα+1√,α+5 −2Lα+3,α+4

α = 1, ..., 7 (B2)
α = 8, ..., 14.

The quadratic Casimir operator is given by

(|ϕ+,+ , |ϕ−,− ) ⊕ (|ϕ+,− , |ϕ−,+ ) ≡ Φe ⊕ Φo, (A2)
where the subscripts a, b = ± in ψa,b refer to the fermion parity of the ﬁrst and second species of Majorana fermion. Φe,o refers to the sector with the total fermion parity even/odd. Each sector with a given total fermion parity is two-fold degenerate. The fusion rule is Ψo × Ψo = ϕ+,+ + ϕ−,−. Then being isomorphic to the Ising primary ﬁelds, Ψe ∼= (I, ψ) while Ψo ∼= (σ, µ) ∼= σ˜, which is the 1-qubit. Thus, we recover the fusion rule as that in the Ising model. Hence, the many-body Majorana fermions of two species at the edge of multilayer thin ﬁlms of the topological superconductor obey non-Abelian statistics.
This is also the case for the Kitaev chain [31], the gapless Majorana edge modes of Kitaev honeycomb spin model [19], and the model of Lian et al. [65].
This two species approach has in fact been studied in earlier pioneering works, e.g., Nayak and Wilczek (Section 9 in [32]) and Ivanov [33].
As we showed in this work, since we cannot braid the two M√ajorana objects from a charged fermion, we do not have Z gate. Thus, this type of non-Abelian Majorana

Appendix D: details of device realizations of G(− π4 ), G( 1π0 ) and G( 25π )

As described in the main text, by a proper arrangement of the interaction areas, the device in Fig. 3(a) of the main text can realize G(− π4 ), G( 1π0 ) and G( 25π ). The details are shown in Fig. 17.

Appendix E: The electric signals with phase gates
Consider the setup in Fig. 4 in the main text. The phase gate is represented by Gij(θ) = diag(1, e−i2θ) = diag(1, e−iη) on the basis |0γiγj and |1γiγj , where 0

and 1 labels the fermion number. Then, in the parity even basis (|0A0B0C , |0A1B1C , |1A0B1C , |1A1B0C )T , the transformation matrix corresponding to Fig. 4 in the
main text reads

where ηij = ηi + ηj and ηijk = ηi + ηj + ηk. Notice that
the conductance between Lead 2 and Lead 3 is σ23 = (1 − | ψf |ψi |2)e2/h, then if we choose the initial state
|ψi = |0A0B1C , then the ﬁnal state is

|ψf = − 1 (1 − e−iη5 )|0A0B0C 2
+ 1 [ie−iη12 (1 + e−iη5 )]|0A1B1C , 2

(E2)

and the corresponding conductance is σ23 = cos2(θ5) eh2 . Similar results for electric signals can be obtained for the

other three initial states. Furthermore, one solution for

the CNOT gate is

2θ1 =

π 2

and 2θ2 = 2θ3 = 2θ4 = 2θ5 =

− π2 , and the they can be realized through topological π4 -

phase gates.

Appendix F: Details of the CNOT gate in sparse encoding

In the sparse encoding, 2-qubits are associated with 4
pairs of MEMs (γ1, γ2), ..., (γ7, γ8) labeled as A, B, C, D. If choosing the even FP input state given by γ1γ2γ3γ4 = γ5γ6γ7γ8 = +1, the basis of system is

{|0A0B0C 0D , |0A0B1C 1D , |1A1B0C 0D , |1A1B1C 1D }.

We take γ4,5 as an ancillary qubit and measure its FP, i.e., iγ4γ5. Before measuring, γ6 exchanges with γ4,5 and forms a new pair with γ3. This equals to act B45B56 on the γ3γ4γ5γ6 and gives superposition states

 |0A0B0C 0D + |0A1B1C 0D   i|0A0B1C 1D − i|0A1B0C 1D   |1A0B1C 0D + |1A1B0C 0D 
−i|1A0B0C 1D + i|1A1B1C 1D

(F1)

We then measure iγ4γ5 and go ahead when it is even. This means that the fermion number of the pair C is 0,

17

and the remaining state is

{|0A0B0D , i|0A1B1D , |1A1B0D , i|1A0B1D },

which is 2-qubits for the dense encoding in odd FP. Acting the CNOT in the dense encoding on this state,
the output state is given by

{|0A0B0D , i|0A1B1D , |1A0B1D , i|1A1B0D }

Putting γ4,5 with iγ4γ5 = 1 back, we have

{|0A0B0C 0D , i|0A1B0C 1D , |1A0B0C 1D , i|1A1B0C 0D }.

Braiding γ6 with γ4, γ5 again, we get the superposition state

 |0A0B0C 0D − i|0A1B1C 0D   |0A0B1C 1D − i|0A1B0C 1D   i|1A0B0C 1D + |1A1B1C 1D 
i|1A0B1C 0D + |1A1B0C 0D

(F2)

Finally we measure γ5γ6γ7γ8. If it is +1, we have the FP even output state in the sparse encoding
{|0A0B0C 0D , |0A0B1C 1D , |1A1B1C 1D , |1A1B0C 0D }
This process implements a CNOT gate in the sparse encoding with the FP even. Similarly, we can also design the CNOT gate with FP odd.
