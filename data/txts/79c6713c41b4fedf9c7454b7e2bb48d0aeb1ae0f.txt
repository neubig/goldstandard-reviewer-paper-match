Abstract
This paper proposes a new approach to construct high quality space-ﬁlling sample designs. First, we propose a novel technique to quantify the space-ﬁlling property and optimally trade-oﬀ uniformity and randomness in sample designs in arbitrary dimensions. Second, we connect the proposed metric (deﬁned in the spatial domain) to the objective measure of the design performance (deﬁned in the spectral domain). This connection serves as an analytic framework for evaluating the qualitative properties of space-ﬁlling designs in general. Using the theoretical insights provided by this spatial-spectral analysis, we derive the notion of optimal space-ﬁlling designs, which we refer to as space-ﬁlling spectral designs. Third, we propose an eﬃcient estimator to evaluate the space-ﬁlling properties of sample designs in arbitrary dimensions and use it to develop an optimization framework to generate high quality space-ﬁlling designs. Finally, we carry out a detailed performance comparison on two diﬀerent applications in 2 to 6 dimensions: a) image reconstruction and b) surrogate modeling on several benchmark optimization functions and an inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) simulation code. We demonstrate that the propose spectral designs signiﬁcantly outperform existing approaches especially in high dimensions.

1. Introduction
Exploratory analysis and inference in high dimensional parameter spaces is a ubiquitous problem in science and engineering. As a result, a wide-variety of machine learning tools and optimization techniques have been proposed to address this challenge. In its most generic formulation, one is interested in analyzing a high-dimensional function f : D → R deﬁned on the d-dimensional domain D. A typical approach for such an analysis is to ﬁrst create an initial sampling X = {xi ∈ D}Ni=1 of D, evaluate f at all xi, and perform subsequent analysis and learning using only the resulting tuples {(xi, f (xi))}Ni=1. Despite the widespread use of this approach, a critical question that still persists is: how should one obtain a high quality initial sampling X for which the data f (X ) is collected? This challenge is typically refered to as Design of Experiments (DoE) and solutions have been proposed as early as (Fisher, 1935) to optimize agricultural experiments. Subsequently, DoE has received signiﬁcant attention from researchers in diﬀerent ﬁelds (Garud et al., 2017) as it is an important building block for a wide variety of applications, such as surrogate modeling, image reconstruction, reinforcement learning, or data analysis. In several scenarios, it has been shown that success crucially depends on the quality of the initial sampling X . Currently, a plethora of sampling solutions exist in the literature with a wide-range of assumptions and statistical guarantees; see (Garud et al., 2017; Owen, 2009) for a detailed review of related methods. Conceptually, most approaches aim to cover the sampling domain as uniformly as possible, in order to generate the so called space-ﬁlling experimental designs. However, it is well know that uniformity alone does not necessarily lead to high performance. For example, optimal sphere packings lead to highly uniform designs, yet are well known to cause strong aliasing artifacts most easily perceived in many computer graphics applications. Instead, a common assumption is that a good design should balance uniformity and randomness. Unfortunately, an exact deﬁnition for what should be considered a good space-ﬁlling design remains elusive.
Most common approaches use various scalar metrics to encapsulate diﬀerent notions of ideal sampling properties. One popular metric is the discrepancy of an experimental design, deﬁned as an appropriate p norm of the ratio of points within all (hyper-rectangular) sub-volumes of D and the corresponding volume ratio. In other words, discrepancy quantiﬁes the non-uniformity of a sample design. The most prominent examples of so called discrepancy sequences are Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods and their variants (Caﬂisch, 1998). In their classical form, discrepancy sequences are deterministic though extensions to incorporate randomess have been proposed, for example, using digital scrambling (Owen, 1995). Nevertheless, by optimizing for discrepancy these techniques focus almost exclusively on uniformity, and consequently even optimized QMC patterns can be quite structured and create aliasing artifacts. Furthermore, even the fastest known strategies for evaluating popular discrepancy measures require O(N 2d) operations making evaluation, let alone optimization, for discrepancy diﬃcult even for moderate dimensions. Finally, for most discrepancy measures, the optimal achievable values are not known. This makes it diﬃcult to determine whether a poorly performing sample design is due to the insuﬃciency of the chosen discrepancy measure or due to ineﬀective optimization.
Another class of metrics to describe sample designs are based on geometric distances. These can be used directly by, for example, optimizing the maximin or minimax distance of a sample design (Schl¨omer et al., 2011) or indirectly by enforcing empty disk conditions.

A Spectral Approach for the Design of Experiments: Design, Analysis and Algorithms
The latter is the basis for the so-called Poisson disk samples (Lagae and Dutr, 2008), which aim to generate random points such that no two samples can be closer than a given minimal distance rmin, i.e. enforcing an empty disc of radius rmin around each sample. Typically, Poisson-type samples are characterized by the relative radius, ρ, deﬁned as the ratio of the minimum disk radius rmin and the maximum possible disk radius rmax for N samples to cover the sampling domain. Similar to the discrepancy sequences, maximin and minimax designs exclusively consider uniformity, are diﬃcult to optimize for especially in higher dimensions, and often lead to very regular patterns. Poisson disk samples use ρ to trade oﬀ randomness (lower ρ values) and uniformity (higher ρ values). A popular recommendation in 2-d is to aim for 0.65 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.85 as a good compromise. However, there does not exist any theoretical guidance for choosing ρ and hence, optimal values for higher dimensions are not known. As discussed in more detail in Section 2, there also exist a wide variety of techniques that combine diﬀerent metrics and heuristics. For example, Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS) aims to spread the sample points uniformly by stratiﬁcation, and one can potentially optimize the resulting design using maximin or minimax techniques (Jin et al., 2005).
In general, scalar metrics to evaluate the quality of a sample design tend not to be very descriptive. Especially in high dimensions diﬀerent designs with, for example, the same ρ can exhibit widely diﬀerent performance and for some discrepancy sequences the optimal designs converge to random samples in high dimensions (Morokoﬀ and Caﬂisch, 1994; Wang and Sloan, 2008). Furthermore, one rarely knows the best achievable value of the metric, i.e. the lowest possible discrepancy, for a given problem which makes evaluating and comparing sampling designs diﬃcult. Finally, most metrics are expensive to compute and not easily optimized. This makes it challenging in practice to create good designs in high dimensions and with large sample sizes.
To alleviate this problem, we propose a new technique to quantify the space-ﬁlling property, which enables us to systematically trade-oﬀ uniformity and randomness, consequently producing better quality sampling designs. More speciﬁcally, we use tools from statistical mechanics to connect the qualitative performance (in the spectral domain) of a sampling pattern with its spatial properties characterized by the pair correlation function (PCF). The PCF measures the distribution of point samples as a function of distances, thus, providing a holistic view of the space-ﬁlling property (See Figure 1(b)). Furthermore, we establish the connection between the PCF and the power spectral density (PSD) via the 1−D Hankel transform in arbitrary dimensions, thus providing a relation between the PCF and an objective measure of sampling quality to help subsequent design and analysis.
Using insights from the analysis of space-ﬁlling designs in the spectral domain, we provide design guidelines to systematically trade-oﬀ uniformity and randomness for a good sampling pattern. The analytical tractability of the PCF enables us to perform theoretical analysis in the spectral domain to derive the structure of optimal space-ﬁlling designs, referred to as space-ﬁlling spectral design in the rest of this paper. Next, we develop an edge corrected kernel density estimator based technique to measure the space-ﬁlling property via PCFs in arbitrary dimensions. In contrast to existing PCF estimation techniques, the proposed PCF estimator is both accurate and computationally eﬃcient. Based on this estimator, we develop a systematic optimization framework and a novel algorithm to synthesize space-ﬁlling spectral designs. In particular, we propose to employ a weighted least-squares

based gradient descent optimization, coupled with the proposed PCF estimator, to accurately match the optimal space-ﬁlling spectral design deﬁned in terms of the PCF.
Note that, there is a strong connection between the proposed space-ﬁlling spectral designs and coverage based designs such as Poisson Disk Sampling (PDS) (Gamito and Maddock, 2009). However, the major diﬀerence lies in the metric/criterion these techniques use to estimate and optimize the space-ﬁlling designs. Furthermore, existing works on PDS focus primarily on algorithmic issues, such as worst-case running times and numerical issues associated with providing high-quality implementations. However, diﬀerent PDS methods often demonstrate widely diﬀerent performances which raises the questions of how to evaluate the qualitative properties of diﬀerent PDS patterns and how to deﬁne an optimal PDS pattern? We argue that, coverage (ρ) based metrics alone are insuﬃcient for understanding the statistical aspects of PDS. This makes it diﬃcult to generate high quality PDS patterns. As we will demonstrate below, existing PDS approaches largely ignore the randomness objective and instead concentrate exclusively on the coverage objective resulting in inferior sampling patterns compared to space-ﬁlling spectral designs, especially in high dimensions. Note that, on the other hand, the proposed PCF based metric does not have these limitations and enables a comprehensive analysis of statistical properties of spaceﬁlling designs (including PDS), while producing higher quality sampling patterns compared to the state-of-the-art PDS approaches.
In (Kailkhura et al., 2016a), we use the PCF to understand the nature of PDS and provided theoretical bounds on the sample size of achievable PDS. Here we signiﬁcantly extend our previous work and provide a more comprehensive analysis of the problem along with a novel space-ﬁlling spectral designs, an edge corrected PCF estimator, an optimization approach to synthesize the space-ﬁlling spectral designs and a detailed evaluation of the performance of the proposed sample design. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
• We provide a novel technique to quantify the space-ﬁlling property of sample designs in arbitrary dimensions and systematically trade-oﬀ uniformity and randomness.
• We use tools from statistical mechanics to connect the qualitative performance (in the spectral domain) of a sample design with its spatial properties characterized by the PCF.
• We develop a computationally eﬃcient edge corrected kernel density estimator based technique to estimate the space-ﬁlling property in arbitrary dimensions.
• Using theoretical insights obtained via spectral analysis of point distributions, we provide design guidelines for optimal space-ﬁlling designs.
• We devise a systematic optimization framework and a gradient descent optimization algorithm to generate high quality space-ﬁlling designs.
• We demonstrate the superiority of proposed space-ﬁlling spectral samples compared to existing space-ﬁlling approaches through rigorous empirical studies on two diﬀerent applications: a) image reconstruction and b) surrogate modeling on several benchmark optimization functions and an inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) simulation code.

2. Related Work
In this section, we provide a brief overview of existing approaches for creating space-ﬁlling sampling patterns. Note that, the prior art for this long-studied research area is too extensive, and hence we recommend interested readers to refer to (Garud et al., 2017; Owen, 2009) for a more comprehensive review.
2.1 Latin Hypercube Sampling
Monte-Carlo methods form an important class of techniques for space-ﬁlling sample design. However, it is well known that Monte-Carlo methods are characterized by high variance in the resulting sample distributions. Consequently, variance reduction methods are employed in practice to improve the performance of simple Monte Carlo techniques. One example is stratiﬁed sampling using the popular Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) (McKay, 1992; Packham, 2015). Since its inception, several variants of LHS have been proposed with the goal of achieving better space-ﬁlling properties, in addition to reducing variance. A notable improvement in this regard are techniques that achieve LHS space ﬁlling not only in onedimensional projections, but also in higher dimensions. For example, Tang (Tang, 1993; Leary et al., 2003) introduced orthogonal-array-based Latin hypercube sampling to improve space-ﬁlling in higher dimensional subspaces. Furthermore, a variety of space-ﬁlling criteria such as entropy, integrated mean square error, minimax and maximin distances, have been utilized for optimizing LHS (Jin et al., 2005). A particularly eﬀective and widely adopted metric is the maximin distance criterion, which maximizes the minimal distance between points to avoid designs with points too close to one another (Morris and Mitchell, 1995). A detailed study on LHS and its variants can be found in (Koehler and Owen, 1996).
2.2 Quasi Monte Carlo Sampling
Following the success of Monte-Carlo methods, Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling was introduced in (Halton, 1964) and since then has become the de facto solution in a wide-range
5

anonymous
of applications (Caﬂisch, 1998; Wang and Sloan, 2008). The core idea of QMC methods is to replace the random or pseudo-random samples in Monte-Carlo methods with well-chosen deterministic points. These deterministic points are chosen such that they are highly uniform, which can be quantiﬁed using the measure of discrepancy. Low-discrepancy sequences along with bounds on their discrepancy were introduced in the 1960’s by Halton (Halton, 1964) and Sobol (Sobol, 1967), and are still in use today. However, despite their eﬀectiveness, a critical limitation of QMC methods is that error bounds and statistical conﬁdence bounds of the resulting designs cannot be obtained due to the deterministic nature of lowdiscrepancy sequences. In order to alleviate this challenge, randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling has been proposed (L’Ecuyer and Lemieux, 2005), and in many cases shown to be provably better than the classical QMC techniques (Owen and Tribble, 2005). This has motivated the development of other randomized quasi-Monte Carlo techniques, for example, methods based on digital scrambling (Owen, 1995).
2.3 Poisson Disk Sampling
While discrepancy-based designs have been popular among uncertainty quantiﬁcation researchers, the computer graphics community has had long-standing success with coveragebased designs. In particular, Poisson disk sampling (PDS) is widely used in applications such as image/volume rendering. The authors in (Dipp´e and Wold, 1985; Cook, 1986) were the ﬁrst to introduce PDS for turning regular aliasing patterns into featureless noise, which makes them perceptually less visible. Their work was inspired by the seminal work of Yellott et.al. (Yellott, 1983), who observed that the photo-receptors in the retina of monkeys and humans are distributed according to a Poisson disk distribution, thus explaining its eﬀectiveness in imaging.
Due to the broad interest created by the initial work on PDS, a large number of approaches to generate Poisson disk distributions have been developed over the last decade (Gamito and Maddock, 2009; Ebeida et al., 2012, 2011; Ip et al., 2013; Bridson, 2007; O¨ ztireli and Gross, 2012; Heck et al., 2013; Wei, 2008; Dunbar and Humphreys, 2006; Wei, 2010; Balzer et al., 2009; Geng et al., 2013; Yan and Wonka, 2012, 2013; Ying et al., 2013b, 2014; Hou et al., 2013; Ying et al., 2013a; Guo et al., 2014; Wachtel et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014; Ebeida et al., 2014; de Goes et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012). Most Poisson disk sample generation methods are based on dart throwing (Dipp´e and Wold, 1985; Cook, 1986), which attempts to generate as many darts as necessary to cover the sampling domain while not violating the Poisson disk criterion. Given the desired disk size rmin (or coverage ρ), dart throwing generates random samples and rejects or accepts each sample based on its distance to the previously accepted samples. Despite its eﬀectiveness, its primary shortcoming is the choice of termination condition, since the algorithm does not know whether or not the domain is fully covered. Hence, in practice, the algorithm has poor convergence, which in turn makes it computationally expensive. On the other hand, dart throwing is easy to implement and applicable to any sampling domain, even non-Euclidean. For example, Anirudh et.al. use a dart throwing technique to generate Poisson disk samples on the Grassmannian manifold of low-dimensional linear subspaces (Anirudh et al., 2017).
Reducing the computational complexity of PDS generation, particularly in low and moderate dimensions, has been the central focus of many existing eﬀorts. To this end, ap-

proximate techniques that produce sample sets with characteristics similar to Poisson disk have been developed. Early examples (McCool and Fiume, 1992) are relatively simple and can be used for a wide range of sampling domains, but the gain in computational eﬃcacy is limited. Other methods partition the space into grid cells in order to allow parallelization across the diﬀerent cells and achieve linear time algorithms (Bridson, 2007). Another class of approaches, referred to as tile-based methods, have been developed for generating a large number of Poisson disk samples in 2-D. Broadly, these methods either start with a smaller set of samples, often obtained using other PDS techniques, and tile these samples (Wachtel et al., 2014), or alternatively use a regular tile structure for placing each sample (Ostromoukhov et al., 2004). With the aid of eﬃcient data structures, these methods can generate a large number of samples eﬃciently. Unfortunately, these approximations can lead to low sample quality due to artifacts induced at tile boundaries and the inherent non-random nature of tilings. More recently, many researchers have explored the idea of partitioning the sampling space in order to avoid generating new samples that will be ultimately rejected by dart throwing. While some of these methods only work in 2−D (Dunbar and Humphreys, 2006; Ebeida et al., 2011), the eﬃciency of other methods that are designed for higher dimensions (Gamito and Maddock, 2009; Ebeida et al., 2012) drops exponentially with increasing dimensions. Finally, relaxation methods that iteratively increase the Poisson disk radius of a sample set (McCool and Fiume, 1992) by re-positioning the samples also exist. However, these methods have the risk of converging to a regular pattern with tight packing unless randomness is explicitly enforced (Balzer et al., 2009; Schl¨omer et al., 2011).
A popular variant of PDS is the maximal PDS (MPDS) distribution, where the maximality constraint requires that the sample disks overlap, in the sense that they cover the whole domain leaving no room to insert an additional point. In practice, maximal PDS tends to outperform traditional PDS due to better coverage. However, algorithmically guaranteeing maximality requires expensive checks causing the resulting algorithms to be slow in moderate (2-5) and practically unfeasible in higher (7 and above) dimensions. Though strategies to alleviate this limitation have been proposed in (Ebeida et al., 2012), the ineﬃciency of MPDS algorithms in higher dimensions still persists. Interestingly, a common limitation of all existing MPDS approaches is that there is no direct control over the number of samples produced by the algorithm, which makes the use of these algorithms diﬃcult in practice, since optimizing samples for a given sample budget is the most common approach.
As discussed in Section 1, the metrics used by the space-ﬁlling designs discussed above do not provide insights into how to systematically trade-oﬀ uniformity and randomness. Thereby, making the design and optimization of sampling pattern a cumbersome process. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel metric for assessing the space-ﬁlling property and connect the proposed metric (deﬁned in the spatial domain) to the objective measure of design performance (deﬁned in the spectral domain).
3. A Metric for Assessing Space-ﬁlling Property
In this section we ﬁrst provide a deﬁnition of a space-ﬁlling design. Subsequently, we propose a metric to quantify space-ﬁlling properties of sample designs.

3.1 Space-ﬁlling Designs
Without any prior knowledge of the function f of interest, a reasonable objective when creating X is that the samples should be random to provide an equal chance of ﬁnding features of interest, e.g., local minima in an optimization problem, anywhere in D. However, to avoid sampling only parts of the parameter space, a second objective is to cover the space in D uniformly, in order to guarantee that all suﬃciently large features are found. Therefore, a good space-ﬁlling design can be deﬁned as follows:

Figure 4: Performance Quality Metric: Power spectral density is used to characterize the eﬀectiveness of sample designs, through the distribution of power in diﬀerent frequencies.

Deﬁnition 1 A space-ﬁlling design is a set of xi’s that are randomly distributed (Objective 1: Randomness) but no two samples are closer than a given minimum distance rmin (Objective 2: Coverage).
Next, we describe the metric that we use to quantify the space-ﬁlling property of a sample design. The proposed metric is based on the spatial statistic, pair correlation function (PCF) and we will show that this metric is directly linked to an objective measure of design performance deﬁned in the spectral domain.
3.2 Pair Correlation Function as a Space-ﬁlling Metric
In contrast to existing scalar space-ﬁlling metrics such as discrepancy, and coverage, the PCF characterizes the distribution of sample distances, thus providing a comprehensive description of the sample designs. More speciﬁcally, PCF describes the joint probability of having sampling points at a certain distance apart. A precise deﬁnition of the PCF can be given in terms of the intensity λ and product density β of a point process (Illian et al., 2008; O¨ ztireli and Gross, 2012).
Deﬁnition 2 Let us denote the intensity of a point process X as λ(X ), which is the average number of points in an inﬁnitesimal volume around X . For isotropic point processes, this is a constant value. To deﬁne the product density β, let {Bi} denote the set of inﬁnitesimal spheres around the points, and {dVi} indicate the volume measures of Bi. Then, we have
9

P (x1, · · · , xN) = β(x1, · · · , xN)dV1 · · · dVN . In the isotropic case, for a pair of points, β depends only on the distance between the points, hence one can write β(xi, xj) = β(||xi − xj||) = β(r) and P (r) = β(r)dxdy. The PCF is then deﬁned as

β

G(r) = λ2 .

(1)

Note that, the PCF characterizes spatial properties of a sample design. However, in several cases, it is easier to link the objective performance of a sample design to its spectral properties. Therefore, we establish a connection between the spatial property of a sample design deﬁned in PCF space to its spectral properties.

3.3 Connecting Spatial Properties and Spectral Properties of Space-ﬁlling Designs
Fourier analysis is a standard approach for understanding the objective properties of sampling patterns. Hence, we propose to analyze the spectral properties of sample designs, using tools such as the power spectral density, in order to assess their quality. For isotropic samples, a quality metric of interest is the radially-averaged power spectral density, which describes how the signal power is distributed over diﬀerent frequencies.

Deﬁnition 3 For a ﬁnite set of N points, {xj}Nj=1, in a region with unit volume, the radially-averaged power spectral density (PSD) is formally deﬁned as

P (k) = 1 |S(k)|2 = 1 e−2πik(x −xj),

where S(k) denotes the Fourier transform of the sample function.

Next, we show that the connection between spectral properties of a d-dimensional isotropic sample design and its corresponding pair correlation function can be obtained via the ddimensional Fourier transform or more eﬃciently using the 1-d Hankel transform.

Proposition 4 For an isotropic sample design with N points, {xj}Nj=1, in a d-dimensional region with unit volume, the pair correlation function G(r) and radially averaged power
spectral density P (k) are related as follows:

Proposition 4 is important as it enables us to qualitatively understand space-ﬁlling designs by ﬁrst mapping them into the PCF space constructed based on spatial distances between points and, then, evaluating and understanding spectral properties of sample designs.
In Figure 3, we show the PCF1 of some commonly used 2-d sample designs (N = 1000) illustrated in Figure 2. As can be observed, both regular grid samples and QMC sequences have signiﬁcant oscillations in their PCFs, which can be attributed to their structured nature. Regular grid sample design demonstrates a large disk radius rmin (G(r) = 0 for 0 ≤ r ≤ rmin) as every sample is at least rmin apart from the rest of the samples, which in turn implies a better coverage. However, in practice, they perform poorly compared to randomized sample designs and this can be understood by studying their spectral properties. In contrast, random sample (Monte-Carlo) designs have a constant PCF with nearly no oscillations, since point samples are uncorrelated, thus, P (r) = λdxλdy and theoretically have G(r) = 1, ∀r. Furthermore, the LHS design has a similar PCF as random designs with the exception of a small, yet non-zero, rmin.
Other variants of PDS like MPDS, Step PCF and Stair PCF designs attempt to trade-oﬀ between coverage (G(r) = 0 for 0 ≤ r ≤ rmin) and randomness G(r) = 1, for r > rmin. Note that, the Step and the Stair PCF methods are space-ﬁlling spectral designs proposed later in this paper. However, upon a careful comparison, it can be seen that MPDS has a larger peak and more oscillations in its PCF compared to the proposed designs. In fact, our empirical studies show that the amount of oscillations in the PCF of the MPDS design signiﬁcantly increases with dimensions.
Next, in Figure 4, we show the corresponding PSDs of the diﬀerent sample designs. It can be seen that, oscillations in PCF directly correspond to oscillations in PSDs. For

example, the oscillatory behavior of the PCF for regular and QMC sequences cause a nonuniform distribution of power in their corresponding PSDs. Furthermore, the larger peak height in the PCF of MPDS implies that a large amount of power is concentrated in a small frequency band instead of power being distributed over all frequencies. In Section 5, we will analyze the eﬀect of the shape of PCF on the performance of a sample design in detail.
It is important to note that, not every PCF (or PSD) is physically realizable by a sample design. In fact, there are two necessary mathematical conditions 2 that a sample design must satisfy to be realizable.
Deﬁnition 5 (Realizability) A PCF can be deﬁned to be realizable through a sample design, if it satisﬁes the following conditions:
• its PCF must be non-negative, i.e., G(r) ≥ 0, ∀r, and
• its corresponding PSD must be non-negative, i.e., P (k) ≥ 0, ∀k.
As both the PSD and the PCF characteristics are strongly tied to each other (as shown in Proposition 4), these two conditions limit the space of realizable space-ﬁlling spectral designs. The results from this section will serve as tools for qualitatively understanding and, thus, designing optimal space-ﬁlling spectral designs in the following sections.
4. Space-ﬁlling Spectral Designs
In this section, we ﬁrst formalize desired characteristics of a good space-ﬁlling design, as given in Deﬁnition 1. Next, we will describe the proposed framework for creating spaceﬁlling spectral designs.
Deﬁnition 6 A set of N point samples X in a sampling domain D can be characterized as a space-ﬁlling design, if X = {xi ∈ D; i = 1, · · · N } satisfy the following two objectives:
• ∀xi ∈ X , ∀ D ⊆ D : P (xi ∈ D) = D dx
• ∀xi, xj ∈ X : ||xi − xj|| ≥ rmin
where rmin is referred to as the coverage radius.
In the above deﬁnition, the ﬁrst objective states that the probability of a uniformly distributed random sample xi ∈ X falling inside a subset D of D is equal to the hyper-volume of D. The second condition enforces the minimum distance constraint between point sample pairs for improving coverage.
A Poisson design enforces the ﬁrst condition alone, in which case the number of samples that fall inside any subset D ⊆ D obeys a discrete Poisson distribution. Though easier to implement, Poisson sampling often produces distributions where the samples are grouped into clusters and leaves holes in possibly the regions of interest. In other words, this increases the risk of missing important features, when only the samples are used for analysis.
2. Whether or not these two conditions are not only necessary but also suﬃcient is still an open question (however, no counterexamples are known).

A Spectral Approach for the Design of Experiments: Design, Analysis and Algorithms

Consequently, a sample design that distributes random samples in a uniform manner across D is preferred, so that clustering patterns are not observed. The coverage condition explicitly eliminates the clustering behavior by preventing samples from being closer than rmin. A space-ﬁlling design can be deﬁned conveniently in the PCF domain and we refer to this as the space-ﬁlling spectral design, due to its direct connection to the spectral domain properties.

4.1 Deﬁning a Space-ﬁlling Spectral Design in Spatial Domain
For Poisson design, point locations are not correlated and, therefore, P (r) = λdxλdy. This implies that for Poisson designs G(r) = 1. Similarly, for space-ﬁlling designs, due to the minimum distance constraint between the point sample pairs, we do not have any point samples in the region 0 ≤ r < rmin. Consequently, space-ﬁlling spectral designs are deﬁned as a step pair correlation function in the spatial domain (Step PCF ).

Proposition 7 Given the desired coverage radius rmin, a space-ﬁlling spectral design is deﬁned in the spatial domain as

G(r − rmin) =

0 if r < rmin 1 if r ≥ rmin.

As a consequence of Proposition 4, space-ﬁlling spectral designs can equivalently be deﬁned in the spectral domain.

4.2 Deﬁning a Space-ﬁlling Spectral Design in Spectral Domain
We derive the power spectral density of the space-ﬁlling spectral design using the connection established in Section 3. Following our earlier notation, we denote the d-dimensional power spectral density by P (k) and d-dimensional PCF by G(r).

Proposition 8 Given the desired coverage radius rmin, a d-dimensional space-ﬁlling spectral design X , with N sample points in a sampling domain D of volume V , can be deﬁned in the PSD domain as

This proposition connects the spatial properties of a space-ﬁlling spectral design, deﬁned via the PCF, to its spectral properties. The motivation for this is the fact that in several cases, it is easier to link the objective performance of a sample design to its spectral properties. In the next section, we will develop the relation between spectral properties and an objective measure of the performance, which in turn provides us guidelines for designing better spaceﬁlling spectral sampling patterns.
5. Qualitative Analysis of Space-ﬁlling Spectral Designs
In this section, we derive insights regarding the objective performance of space-ﬁlling spectral designs. To this end, we analyze the impact of the shape of the PCF on the reconstruction performance. Further, for a tractable analysis, we consider the task of recovering the class of periodic functions using space-ﬁlling spectral designs and analyze the reconstruction error as a function of their spectral properties. The analysis presented in this section will clarify how the shape of the PCF of a sample design directly impacts its reconstruction performance.
5.1 Analysis of Reconstruction Error for Periodic Functions
Let us denote the Fourier transform of the sample design X by S. The function to be sampled and its corresponding Fourier representation are denoted by I and Iˆ(k) respectively. Now, the spectrum of the sampled function is given by Iˆs(k) = S ∗ Iˆ(k). Note that, a sampling pattern with a ﬁnite number of points is comprised of two components, a DC peak at the origin and a noisy remainder S¯. Thus, equivalently, we have Iˆs(k) = {nδ(k) + S¯} ∗ Iˆ(k). The error introduced in the process of function reconstruction is the diﬀerence between the
14

A Spectral Approach for the Design of Experiments: Design, Analysis and Algorithms

reconstructed and the original functions: E(k) = |Iˆs(k)/N − I(k)|2 = |S¯ ∗ Iˆ(k)/N |2

where we have divided the R.H.S. by N to normalize the energy of Is. For error analysis, we focus on the low frequency content of the error term, since the high frequency components are removed during the reconstruction process.
Denoting the power spectrum without the DC component by P (k), for a constant function the error simpliﬁes to

E(k) ∝ |S (k)|2 ∝ P (k).

(9)

This, as stated above, allows for the characterization of the error in terms of the spectral properties of the sampling pattern used.
Next, we consider an important class of functions, the family of periodic functions, for further analysis. All periodic functions with a ﬁnite period can be expressed as a Fourier series, which is a summation of sine and cosine terms

M

M

I(x) = a0 + amcos(2πmx) + bmsin(2πmx).

m=1

m=1

The Fourier transform of this function is equivalently a summation of pulses:

Iˆ(k) = a0δ(k) + M am 21 (δ(k − m) + δ(k + m) + M bm 12 (δ(k + m) − δ(k − m)) .

m=1

m=1

Making substitutions, am + bm = Am, am − bm = Bm, we obtain

1

M

2

E(k) = 4N 2 4a0S (k) +

AmS (k + m) + BmS (k − m) .

m=1

The reconstruction error can then be upper bounded as follows:

12

E(k) ≤ 4N

4a0P (k) +

AmP (k + m) + BmP (k − m) .

(10)

In the case of a single sinusoidal function, cos(2πf x), using triangle inequality, this becomes (Heck et al., 2013)

1

E(k) ≤ P (k + f ) + P (k − f ) + 2 P (k + f )P (k − f ) .

(11)

4N

Even though this is only an upper bound, we will see that it accurately predicts the characteristics of the sampling error and provides useful guidelines.
The above analysis implies that to assess the quality of the sample designs, one can analyze their spectral behavior. More speciﬁcally, the above analysis suggests that to minimize the reconstruction error: (a) the power spectra of the sample design should be close to

15

anonymous

zero, and (b) for errors to be broadband white noise (uniform over frequencies), the power spectra should be a constant. Note that, in several applications, e.g., image reconstruction, most relevant information is predominantly at low frequencies. In such scenarios, this naturally leads to the following criteria for sample designs: (a) the spectrum should be close to zero for low frequencies which indicates the range of frequencies that can be represented with almost no error, (b) the spectrum should be a constant for high frequencies or contain minimal amount of oscillations in the power spectrum.

5.2 Eﬀect of PCF Characteristics on Sampling Performance
Based on the two criteria discussed above, we assess the eﬀect of the shape of the PCF on the quality of space-ﬁlling designs in the spectral domain. Note that, PCFs of the samples constructed in practice (Figure 2) often demonstrates the following characteristics: (a) presence of a zero-region characterized by rmin, (b) a large peak around rmin, and (c) damped oscillations. To model and analyze these characteristics, we consider the following parametric PCF family:

G(r) = G(r − rmin) + a (G(r − rmin) − G(r − rmin − δ))

(12)

a + 4r exp(−r/2) sin(c × r − c)G(r − rmin)

where G(r − rmin) is the Step function, peak width δ ≥ 0 and the peak height a ≥ 1 and last term in (12) corresponds to damped oscillations. This family is a generalization of Step PCF, with additional parameterization of peak height and oscillations in the PCF.

5.2.1 Effect of Peak Height on Spectral Properties
In order to study the impact of increasing peak height in the PCF on the PSD characteristics, we conduct an empirical study. We compute the PSD of a sample design with the following parameters: N = 195, rmin = 0.02, δ = 0.005. Note that, we vary the PCF peak height a, which actually reﬂects the behavior of existing coverage based PDS algorithms. As shown in Figure 5(a), increasing a results in both signiﬁcantly higher low frequency power and larger high frequency oscillations. As expected, the PSD of the Step PCF (or a = 1) performs the best, i.e., the spectrum is close to zero for low frequencies and constant for high frequencies.

5.2.2 Effect of Disk Radius on Spectral Properties
Next, we study the importance of choosing an appropriate rmin (or coverage ρ) while generating sample distributions. In Figure 5(b), we show the PSD for N = 195 and a = 1, with varying disk radius values rmin. For a ﬁxed sample budget, as we increase the radius, we observe two contrasting changes in the PSD: (i) the spectrum tends to be close to zero at low frequencies and (ii) an increase in oscillations for high frequencies. Consequently, there is a trade-oﬀ between low frequency power and high frequency oscillations in power spectra which can be controlled by varying rmin. However, the increase in oscillations are less signiﬁcant compared to the gain in the zero-region. Furthermore, in several applications, low frequency content is more informative, and hence one may still attempt to maximize rmin or coverage.

5.2.3 Effect of Oscillations on Spectral Properties
Finally, we study the eﬀect of oscillations in the PCF on the power distribution in the spectral domain. In Figure 5(c), we plot the PSD for a = 1 with varying amounts of oscillations controlled via the parameter c. It can be seen that introducing oscillations in the PCF results in signiﬁcantly higher low frequency power and larger high frequency oscillations. As expected, the PSD of the Step PCF (or c = 0) behaves the best.
In summary, the discussion in this section suggests that the PCF of an ideal space-ﬁlling spectral design should have the following three properties: (a) large rmin, (b) small peak height, and (c) low oscillations. Since, the Step PCF satisﬁes these three properties, it is expected to be a good space-ﬁlling spectral design. Next, we consider the problem of optimizing the parameter of the Step PCF design, i.e. rmin.

6. Optimization of Step PCF based Space-ﬁlling Spectral Designs
The proposed space-ﬁlling metric enjoys mathematical tractability and is supported by theoretical results as deﬁned in Section 4. This enables us to obtain new insights for optimizing Step PCF based space-ﬁlling spectral designs. In particular, (a) For a ﬁxed rmin, we obtain the maximum number of point samples in any arbitrary dimension d, (b) For a ﬁxed sampling budget N , we derive the maximum achievable rmin in arbitrary dimension d.

6.1 Case 1: Fixed rmin

The problem of ﬁnding the maximum number of point samples in a Step PCF based spaceﬁlling spectral design with a given disk radius rmin can be formalized as follows:

maximum number of point samples possible in a 2-d Step PCF based space-ﬁlling spectral

design is given by

N = V /π(rmin)2,

which again corroborates our bound in Proposition 9.

Alternately, we can also derive the bound for the disk radius of Step PCF with a ﬁxed sampling budget N as follows:

6.3 Relative Radius of Step PCF
As mentioned before, the current literature characterizes coverage by the fraction ρ of the maximum possible radius rmax for N samples to cover the sampling domain, such that rmin = ρrmax. The maximum possible disk radius is achieved by the deterministic hexagonal lattice (Schreiber, 1943) and can be approximated in a d dimensional sampling region as rmax ≈ d CAddN . Here, Ad is the hypervolume of the sampling domain and Cd = Vd/rd with Vd being the hypervolume of a hypersphere with radius r. Note that, a uniformly distributed point set can have a relative radius of 0, and the relative radius of a hexagonal lattice equals 1 (in 2-d). Next, we derive a closed-form expression for the relative radius of Step PCF based design.

Proposition 11 For a ﬁxed sampling budget N , the maximum relative radius ρ for Step
PCF based space-ﬁlling spectral design in the sampling region with volume V is given by 1
ρ = √ where ηd is maximal density of a sphere packing in d-dimensions. 2 d ηd

Note that, ﬁnding the maximal density of a sphere packing for an arbitrary high dimension (except in d = 2, 3 and recently in 8, 24 (viazovska, 2017; Cohn et al., 2017)) is an open problem. Note that, best known packings are often lattices, thus, we use the best known lattices to be an approximation of rmax in our analysis3.

3. We use relative radius as a metric only for analysis and not for design optimization.

Figure 6: Relative radius ρ = rmin/rmax of Step PCF based space-ﬁlling spectral design for diﬀerent dimensions d.
In Figure 6, we plot the relative radius ρ = rmin/rmax of Step PCF for diﬀerent dimensions d. It is interesting to notice that the relative radius of Step PCF based designs increases as the dimension d increases, i.e., Step PCF based designs approach a more regular pattern. Further, note that, for a ﬁxed sampling budget both rmin and rmax increase as the number of dimensions increases. The Step PCF based designs maintain randomness by keeping the PCF ﬂat, but this comes at a cost: the disk radius rmin of these patterns is very small (as can be seen from Figure 6). For several applications, covering the space better (by trading-oﬀ randomness) is more important. In the next section, we will propose a new class of space-ﬁlling spectral designs that can achieve a much higher rmin at the small cost of compromising randomness by introducing a single peak into an otherwise ﬂat PCF.
7. Space-ﬁlling Spectral Designs with Improved Coverage
To improve the coverage of Step PCF base space-ﬁlling spectral design, in this section, we propose a novel space-ﬁlling spectral design which systematically trades-oﬀ randomness with coverage of the resulting samples. Note that, the randomness property can be relaxed either by increasing the peak height of the PCF, or by increasing the amounts oscillations in the PCF (as discussed in Section 5.2). For simplicity4, we adopt the former strategy and use only the peak height parameter. More speciﬁcally, as an alternative to Step PCF, we design the following generalization which we refer as the Stair PCF design.
7.1 Stair PCF based Space-ﬁlling Spectral Design Now, we deﬁne the proposed Stair PCF based space-ﬁlling design and quantify the gains achieved in the coverage characteristics (i.e. rmin). Stair PCF in the Spatial Domain: The Stair PCF construction is deﬁned as follows:
4. In our initial experiments, we found that increasing the peak height alone is suﬃcient for tradingoﬀ randomness to maximize coverage, and performs better than trading-oﬀ randomness by increasing oscillations in the PCF.

(18)

with f (r − r0) = 0 if r ≤ r0 , 1 if r > r0

where r0 ≤ r1 and P0 ≥ 1.

This family of space-ﬁlling spectral designs has three interesting properties:
• except for a single peak in the region r0 ≤ r ≤ r1, the PCF is ﬂat, thus, does not compromise randomness entirely,

• both the height and width of the peak can be optimized to maximize coverage,

• the Step PCF based spectral design can be derived as as a special case of this construction.
A representative example of Stair PCF is shown in Figure (7(a)).

Stair PCF in the Spectral Domain: Following the analysis in the earlier sections, we derive the power spectral density of Stair PCF based space-ﬁlling spectral designs.

Proposition 12 The power spectral density of a Stair PCF based space-ﬁlling spectral designs, G(r; r0, r1, P0), with N samples in the sampling region with volume V is given by

7.2 Coverage Gain with Stair PCF
Ideally, the optimal Stair PCF should be obtained by simultaneously maximizing r0 (:= rmin) and minimizing P0. Furthermore, not all PCFs in the Stair PCF family are realizable. Due to the realizability conditions, the parameters cannot be adjusted independently. The main challenge, therefore, is to ﬁnd the combinations of the three parameters (r0, r1, P0) that is realizable and yield a good sample design. Unlike Step PCF, the closed form expression for the optimal parameters (r0, r1, P0) are diﬃcult to obtain, and, therefore, we explore this family of PCF patterns empirically by searching conﬁgurations for which:
• the disk radius r0 is as high as possible, and
• the PCF is ﬂat with minimal increase in the peak height P0.
7.2.1 Disk Radius rmin vs. Sample Budget N
In this section, we show the increase in coverage (or rmin) obtained by compromising randomness by increasing peak height in the PCF. We constrain the peak height to be below P0 ≤ 1.5 and analyze the gain in rmin due to this small compromise in randomness. Furthermore, we assume that rmsteinp ≤ r0 ≤ 2 × rmsteinp and r0 ≤ r1 ≤ 1.5 × r0. In Figures 7(b) through 7(f), we compare the maximum rmin achieved by the Step and Stair PCF designs, for varying sample sizes in dimensions 2 to 6. It can be seen that introducing a small peak in the PCF results in a signiﬁcant increase in the coverage. This gain can be observed for all sampling budgets in all dimensions. Furthermore, as expected, for low sampling budgets

maximal gain is observed, and should decrease with increasing N as the rmin for both the families will asymptotically (in N ) converge to zero.
7.2.2 Relative Radius ρ vs. Dimension d
In this section, we study the increase in relative radius ρ due to the introduction of a peak in the PCF. Again, we assume that P0 ≤ 1.5, rmsteinp ≤ r0 ≤ 2 × rmsteinp and r0 ≤ r1 ≤ 1.5 × r0. In Figure 8(a), we show the maximum ρ = rmin/rmax achieved by the Step and Stair PCFs for diﬀerent dimensions d. For Stair PCF, we do not have a closed form expression of ρ, thus, we obtain the maximum achievable rmin empirically for various sampling budgets and plot the mean (with standard deviation) behavior of the ρ. It can be seen that introducing a small peak in the PCF results in a signiﬁcant increase in the relative radius. This gain can be observed at all sampling budgets in all dimensions. This also corroborates the recommendation of using 0.65 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.85 in practice for coverage based designs and suggests that in higher dimensions ρ should be higher.
7.2.3 Analysis of Reconstruction Error Upper Bound
We also assess the reconstruction quality of the Step and Stair PCF based spectral designs, on the class of periodic functions considered in Section 5.1, for varying sampling budgets. Here, we consider the setup where 0 ≤ k ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ f ≤ 1000. In Figure 8(b), we plot the average reconstruction error upper bounds as given in (11) for Step and Stair PCF. As expected, for both sample designs, the reconstruction error decreases with an increase in the sampling budget. More interestingly, the reconstruction error of Stair PCF is lower compared to the reconstruction error of Step PCF, thus showing the eﬀectiveness of increased coverage in sample designs.

8. Synthesis of Space-ﬁlling Spectral Designs
In this section, we describe the proposed approach for synthesizing sample designs that match the optimal (Stair or Step) PCF characteristics. Existing approaches for PCF matching such as (O¨ ztireli and Gross, 2012; Kailkhura et al., 2016b) rely on kernel density estimators to evaluate the PCF of a point set. A practical limitation of these approaches is the lack of an eﬃcient PCF estimator in high dimensions. More speciﬁcally, these estimators are biased due to lack of an appropriate edge correction strategy. This bias in PCF estimation arises due to the fact that sample hyper-spheres used in calculating point-pattern statistics may fall partially outside the study region and will produce a biased estimate of the PCF unless a correction is applied. The eﬀect of this bias is barely noticeable in 2 dimensions and hence existing PCF matching algorithms have ignored this. However, this problem becomes severe in higher dimensions, thus, making the matching algorithm highly inaccurate. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce an edge corrected estimator for computing the PCF of sample designs in arbitrary dimensions. Following this, we describe a gradient descent based optimization technique to synthesize samples that match the desired PCF.

8.1 PCF Estimation in High Dimensions with Edge Correction
In order to create an unbiased PCF estimator, we propose to employ an edge corrected kernel density estimator, deﬁned as follows:

k(z) = √πσ exp − 2σ2 . (22)

In the above expression, VW indicates the volume of the sampling region. When the sampling region is a hyper-cube with length 1, we have VW = 1. Let SE denote the area of hypersphere with radius r which is given by

Also, we denote the surface area of the sampling region by SW , which is expressed as

SW = rd−1 sind−2 φ1 sind−3 φ2 · · · sin φd−2.

The term VγW W performs edge correction to handle the unboundedness of the estimator, where γW is an isotropic set covariance function given by

In Figure 9(a), we show that by using an approximate edge correction factor (using the same factor as d = 2), the PCF is wrongly estimated. Moreover, as the dimension increases, the estimated PCF moves farther away from the true PCF very quickly.
Note that, the calculation of the correct edge correction factor requires the evaluation of a multi-dimensional integral which is computationally expensive in high dimensions. In this paper, we provide a closed form approximation of γW (using polynomial regression of order 2) in diﬀerent dimensions d = 2 to 6 when r ≤ 1.0. More speciﬁcally, we have the following approximation γˆW = 1 − a1r + a2r2 where a1 and a2 are as given below.

It can be observed from Figures 9(b) through 9(f) that the proposed approximations are quite tight.

8.2 Synthesis Algorithm
The underlying idea of the proposed algorithm is to iteratively transform an initial random input sample design such that its PCF matches the target PCF. In particular, we propose a non-linear least squares formulation to optimize for the desired space-ﬁlling properties. Let us denote the target PCF by G∗(r). We discretize the radius r into m points {rj}mj=1 and minimize the sum of the weighted squares of errors between the target PCF G∗(rj) and the curve-ﬁt function (kernel density estimator of PCF) G(rj) over m points. This scalar-valued goodness-of-ﬁt measure is referred to as the chi-squared error criterion and can be posed as a non-linear weighted least squares problem as follows.

M

j=1

G(rj) − G∗(rj) 2 ,
wj

where wj indicates the weight (importance) assigned to the ﬁtting error at radius rj. This optimization problem can be eﬃciently solved using a variant of gradient descent algorithm (discussed next), that in our experience converges quickly. In the simplest cases of uniform weights the solution tends to produce a higher ﬁtting error at lower radii rj. To address this challenge we use a non-uniform distribution for the weights {wj}. These weights are initialized to be uniform and are updated in an adaptive fashion in the gradient descent

iterations. The weight wj at gradient descent iteration t + 1 is given by (Kailkhura et al., 2016b):
1 wj = |Gt(rj) − G∗(rj)|
where Gt(rj) is the value of the PCF at radius rj during the gradient descent iteration t. Note that, PCF matching is a highly non-convex problem. We found that the following trick further helps solve PCF matching problem more eﬃciently.

8.2.1 One Sided PCF Smoothing We propose to perform one sided smoothing of the target PCF which is given as follows:

Gˆ∗(r) =

(cr)b if r < rmin 1 if r ≥ rmin.

where c is some pre-speciﬁed constant and b > 1 is the smoothing constant obtained via cross-validation. More speciﬁcally, we add polynomial noise in the low radius region of the PCF. This can also be interpreted as polynomial approximation of the PCF in the low radii regime. We have noticed that sometimes adding a controlled amount of Gaussian noise instead of polynomial noise also improves the performance.

8.2.2 Edge Corrected Gradient Descent
The non-linear least squares problem is solved iteratively using gradient descent. Starting with a random point set X = {xi}Ni=1, we iteratively update xi in the negative gradient direction of the objective function. At each iteration k, this can be formally stated as

xk+1 = xk − λ ∆i ,

i

where λ is the step size and ∆i = {∆ki }dk=1 in the normalized edge corrected gradient is given by

∆i = i=l |xl − xi| j=1 wj (1 − a1rj + a2rj2)rjd−1

(|xl − xi| − rj) k (rj − |xi − xl|) .

(24)

We re-evaluate the PCF G(rj)k of the updated point set after each iteration using the unbiased estimator from the previous section.
In Figure 10, we compare the behavior of the proposed PCF matching algorithm with and without the one sided PCF smoothing. The target PCF is designed using a Step PCF design with rmin as given in Proposition 10. PCF matching is carried out with varying sampling budget, N = 100, 200, 400, 600, 800 for d = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively. The variances of the Gaussian kernel were set at σ2 = 0.0065, 0.007, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01 for d = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively and the step size for the gradient descent algorithm was ﬁxed at 0.001. The value of b was obtained using cross-validation. The initial point set

was generated randomly (uniform) in the unit hyper-cube and matching was carried for 100 gradient descent iterations. It can be observed that the proposed algorithm produces an accurate ﬁt to the target, and that the smoothing actually leads to improved performance.
In Figure 11, we demonstrate the synthesis of a Stair PCF based spectral design, using parameters P0 = 1.2, δ = 0.025. Similar to the previous case, PCF matching is carried out with varying sampling budget, N = 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, for d = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 respectively.

ﬁxed at 0.001. We found that matching the Stair PCF is more challenging for a gradient descent optimization compared to the Step PCF. When a random point set is used for initialization, reaching convergence takes much longer. However, choosing the initial point set intelligently improves the quality of matching signiﬁcantly. In all our experiments, we used the maximal PDS (Ebeida et al., 2012) to initialize the optimization and matching was carried for 100 gradient descent iterations. We observed that another reasonable choice for the initialization is a regular grid sample, and interestingly in most cases it matches the
29

performance of the MPDS initialization. Furthermore, one sided PCF smoothing does not provide signiﬁcant improvements in this case, particularly in higher dimensions.

9. Experiments
In this section, we evaluate the qualitative performance of proposed space-ﬁlling spectral designs and present comparisons to popularly adopted space-ﬁlling designs, such as LHS, QMC and MPDS. Note that, currently, there does not exist any PDS synthesis approach which can generate sample sets with a desired size N while achieving user-speciﬁed spatial characteristics (e.g. relative radius). In all PDS synthesis approaches, there is no control over the number of samples generated by the algorithm which makes the use of these algorithms diﬃcult in practice. However, the proposed approach can control both N and rmin simultaneously. For our qualitative comparison, we perform three empirical studies, in dimensions 2 to 6 : (a) image reconstruction, (b) regression on several benchmark optimization functions, and (c) surrogate modeling for an inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) simulation code.

9.1 Image Reconstruction In this experiment, we consider the problem of designing sample distributions for image reconstruction. More speciﬁcally, we consider the commonly used zone plate test function:
z(r) = (1 + cos(αr2))/2,

with varying levels of complexity (or frequency content) α. Note that, we choose the zone plate for our study over natural images, since it shows the response for a wide range of frequencies and aliasing eﬀects that are not masked by image features. For all zone plate renderings in this paper, we have tiled toroidal sets of 1000 2-dimensional points over the image-plane and utilized a Lanczos ﬁlter with a support of width 4 for resampling. Further, we also report the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) as a quantitative error measure:

1

PSNR

=

20

log10

, MSE

where MSE is the mean squared error. However, it is well known in the image processing community that PSNR can be a weak surrogate for visual quality and, therefore, we also show the reconstructed images.
Table 1 illustrates the reconstructions obtained using diﬀerent space-ﬁlling designs, for varying values of α. It can be observed from the results that the QMC sequences produce a large amount of aliasing artifacts in the high frequency regions, which can be directly linked to the oscillations in their corresponding PCFs. On the other hand, LHS design recovers a small amount of low-frequencies, and maps most of the frequencies to white noise due to its small rmin and near-constant PCF. In contrast, sample designs which attempt to trade-oﬀ between coverage and randomness properties, i.e., MPDS and the proposed spectral spaceﬁlling designs (as seen in Figure 3), have superior reconstruction quality. These designs reduce the aliasing artifacts, have cleaner low frequency content (upper left corner)) and map all high frequencies (bottom right corner) to white noise. More interestingly, we see

that for low complexity cases, i.e., lower α, the MPDS performs the best followed by the proposed Stair and Step PDS respectively. For moderately complex images, the Stair PDS performs the best followed by the Step and the MPDS. Finally, for highly complex images, the Step PDS performs the best followed by the Stair and the MPDS. These observations corroborate our discussion in Section 5.2 that an increase in rmin (coverage) in the PCF results in an increase in the range of low frequencies that can be recovered without aliasing, and equivalently reduction in the amount of oscillations (or an increase in randomness) in the PCF leads to reduced oscillations in the PSD, which in turn indicates a systematic mapping of high frequency content to white noise.

9.2 Regression Modeling for Benchmark Optimization Functions
In this study, we consider the problem of ﬁtting regression models to analytical functions and perform a comparative study of diﬀerent sample designs, in terms of their generalization performance. More speciﬁcally, we consider a set of benchmark analytic functions between dimensions 2 and 6, that are commonly used in global optimization tests (Jamil and Yang, 2013). They are chosen due to their diversity in terms of their complexity and shapes. We compare the performance of proposed space-ﬁlling spectral designs (Step, Stair) with coverage based designs (MPDS), low-discrepancy designs (Halton and Sobol), latin hypercube sampling and random sampling. Appendix A lists the set of functions used in our experiments. In each case, we ﬁt a random forest regressor with 30 trees and repeated for 20 independent realizations of sample designs. We evaluate the generalization performance on 106 regular grid based test samples. Finally, we employ 3 popular quality metrics to quantify the performance of the resulting regression models: mean squared error (MSE), relative average absolute error (AAE), and the R2-statistic. The metrics are deﬁned as follows:
M SE(y, yˆ) = Ni=1(yi − yˆi)2 , (25) N

AAE(y, yˆ) = Ni=1 |yi − yˆi| , (26) N ∗ ST D(y)

R (y, yˆ) = 1 − N (y − M EAN (y))2

(27)

i=1 i

where y = f (x) are the true function values and yˆ are the predicted values. Tables 2 through 6 show the performance of diﬀerent space-ﬁlling designs for various
analytic functions in dimensions 2 to 6, respectively. We see that, for d = 2 (Table 2), LHS and Halton sequences perform better compared to the rest of the sample designs on most of the test functions. However, on some functions, e.g., GoldsteinPrice, Stair PCF and MPDS perform better. Therefore, none of the sample designs consistently guarantee superior performance. For d = 3 (Table 3), we see that Stair PCF design and MPDS (followed by Sobol sequences) perform consistently better compared to the rest of the approaches. As we go higher in dimensions, i.e., d > 3, we notice a signiﬁcant gain in the performance of Stair PCF based space-ﬁlling spectral designs. Interesting, the amount of performance gain of Stair PCF based design increases as we go higher in dimensions. The reason for the

32

A Spectral Approach for the Design of Experiments: Design, Analysis and Algorithms

poor performance of QMC sequences and LHS for d > 3 is due to their poor space-ﬁlling properties in high dimensions (Wang and Sloan, 2008). In comparison, both space-ﬁlling spectral designs and MPDS have good space-ﬁlling properties. We found that Stair PCF design and MPDS have similar coverage characteristics (rmin). However, the diﬀerence in their performance can be attributed to the fact that MPDS designs have signiﬁcantly more oscillations in their PCF compared to an equivalent Stair PCF based space-ﬁlling spectral design, i.e. violation of the randomness objective.

9.3 Surrogate Model Design for an Inertial Conﬁnement Fusion (ICF) Simulator
In this subsection, we consider the problem of designing surrogate models for an inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) simulator developed at the National Ignition Facility (NIF).

most energetic laser built so far onto a tiny capsule containing frozen deuterium. Under the right conditions, the resulting pressure will collapse the target to the point of ignition where hydrogen starts to fuse and produce massive amounts of energy, eﬀectively creating a small star which can be harnessed for energy production. Though signiﬁcant progress has been made, the ultimate goal of “ignition” has not yet been reached.
NIF employs an adaptive pipeline: perform experiments, use post-shot simulations to understand the experimental results, and design new experiments with parameter settings that are expected to improve performance. From an analysis viewpoint, the goal is to search the parameter space to ﬁnd the region that leads to near-optimal performance. The dataset considered here is a so called engineering or macro-physics simulation ensemble in which an implosion is simulated using diﬀerent input parameters, such as, laser power, pulse shape etc. From these simulations, scientists extract a set of drivers, physical quantities believed to determine the behavior of the resulting implosion. These drivers are then analyzed with respect to the energy yield to better understand how to optimize future experiments. As

one can expect, the success of this pipeline heavily depends on the quality of samples used for post-shot simulations.
We use the NIF 1-d HYDRA simulator (Marinak et al., 2001) and compare the performance of proposed space-ﬁlling spectral designs with existing approaches (random, LHS, Halton and Sobol and MPDS). For each simulation run, a large number of output quantities, such as peak velocity, yield, etc., are computed, and subsequently used to describe the resulting implosion. We vary the number of input parameters between 2 and 6, and ﬁx the remaining variables to their default values. In each case, we ﬁt a random forest regressor with 30 trees and repeated for 20 independent realizations of sample designs. We evaluated the reconstruction performance on 105 regular grid based test samples using the metrics in the previous experiment.
Table 7 shows the regression performance of the diﬀerent sample designs for various output quantities in dimensions 2 to 6. We observe that regression error patterns are consistent with our observations in Section 9.2. The proposed Stair PCF based design consistently performs the best (followed by MPDS) for d ≥ 3. Furthermore, the performance gain with the Stair PCF based design improves as we go higher in dimensions. This performance gain can be credited to their ability to achieve better space-ﬁlling properties in high dimensions by intelligently balancing the trade-oﬀ between coverage and randomness, and the eﬀectiveness of the quality metric (PCF) adopted for design and optimization.

analysis, we proposed novel space-ﬁlling spectral designs. We also provided an eﬃcient PCF estimator to evaluate the space-ﬁlling properties of sample designs in arbitrary dimensions. Next, we devised a gradient descent based optimization algorithm to generate high quality space-ﬁlling designs. Superiority of proposed space-ﬁlling spectral designs were shown on two diﬀerent applications in 2 to 6 dimensions: a) image reconstruction and b) surrogate modeling on several benchmark optimization functions and an inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF) simulation code. There are still many interesting questions that remain to be explored in the future work such as an analysis of the problem for non-linear manifolds. Note that, some analytical methodologies used in this paper are certainly exploitable for studying and designing space-ﬁlling designs in diﬀerent manifolds. Other questions such as PCF parameterizations for other variants of space-ﬁlling designs and optimization approaches to synthesize them can also be investigated.
