ABSTRACT
We propose a market-inspired bidding scheme for the assignment of paper reviews in large academic conferences. The primary contribution is an analysis of the incentives of reviewers during the bidding phases, when reviewers have private costs and some information about the demand for each paper, and want to obtain the best possible k papers for a predetermined k.
We show that by assigning budgets to reviewers and a ‘price’ for every paper that is (roughly) inversely proportional to its demand, the best response of a reviewer is to bid sincerely, i.e., on her most favorite papers, and match the budget even when it is not enforced.
Finally, we show via extensive simulations on bidding data from real conferences, that our suggested bidding scheme would substantially improve the assignment, under several common assignment algorithms.
1 INTRODUCTION
Academics spend much of their time and effort (that is, our time and effort) on peer-review for journals and conferences. This is an unpaid labor that academics perform out of sense of duty, which serves several important purposes for all involved parties. It helps editors and program chairs make informed decisions on what papers to publish; it provides authors with valuable feedback on their work; and it keeps the reviewer updated about recent advances in their respective fields.
While in journals the assignment of papers to reviewers is typically handled manually by the editors, peer-reviewed conferences and workshops often use automated assignment algorithms whose outcome is based on the stated preferences of the program committee members (reviewers). The program chairs intervene to solve problems in the assignment, such as allocating papers that no one asked to review. The frequency of these ‘orphan’ papers varies and that this is a recurrent problem in the design of bidding processes (see Table 1 below).
The central problem we consider in this paper is how to improve the assignment in conferences, to the benefit of all involved parties:

reviewers, program chairs, and authors. Crucially, the improvements we suggest are easy to implement: they only require to reveal certain information to the reviewers about the current paper demands. These suggestions are orthogonal to the assignment algorithm and other design choices which are specific to the conference or the platform in use.
In the remainder of Section 1 we describe the current paper assignment process as it is typically performed in large computer science conferences and demonstrate some of the problematic issues using statistics from recent examples. We briefly argue, using ideas from mechanism design, that creating a market for bids is one way to alleviate these problems, we offer a summary of the primary contributions of our work, and explain how it complements previous work in the area.
1.1 The Paper Assignment Process
Consider a large CS conference such as AAAI, IJCAI, ICML, or NeurIPS which have somewhere between 1,000 – 10,000 submissions and 1,000 – 3,000 reviewers. The assignment process typically proceeds through the following steps:
• The program chair recruits program committee members (PCMs) to serve as reviewers. We denote them by the set N where |N | = n. PCMs do not know which papers they are going to review, but rather agree to review some number of papers, which ranges from 4-6 in some conferences to 10-14 in others.
• Authors submit their papers by a certain date. We denote the set of papers by M and |M | = m.
• PCMs get access to papers’ titles and abstracts via an online platform such as EasyChair or Confmaster, and are asked to “bid" on papers they want to review. It is typically possible to bid one of several levels (e.g. “want to review", “can review if needed" etc.) as well as to report a conflict of interests (COI). There are usually 2-5 days to complete the bidding process.
• Typically PCMs are asked (but not enforced) to bid positively on a minimum number R of papers (e.g., 30), R being much higher than the actual number of expected reviews.
• After the bidding round is complete, the bid matrix is fed as input to an assignment algorithm, together with additional constraints such as the minimum and maximum number of

papers per PCM. Each paper should be assigned to a fixed number r of reviewers, typically 2—4. • Once the program chair is satisfied with the assignment, they

forward the assigned papers to PCMs and the reviewing pe-

riod starts. PCMs who are dissatisfied with their assignment

may email the program chair, who handles these issues man-

ually.

On average, each PCM should get k

:=

mr n

papers for review.

There are many assignment algorithms in use, which typically solve

a constrained optimization problem that maximizes the number

of papers that go to PCMs that have bid for them. Conferences

use either an off-the-shelf algorithm provided with the platform or written specifically for the conference [8].1 In other cases, the actual

assignment algorithm itself can be a black-box, see discussion by

Lian et al. [12].

In Table 1 below we provide some data for a few small, medium, and large conferences.2 See more information on anonymized con-

ferences in Table 2. Unfortunately, it is common that the bidding

across papers is highly skewed, with some papers getting an over-

whelming amount of positive bids, while others remain with very

few or none at all (we can see that the EC conference, at least in

2018, is a refreshing outlier!)

The standard protocol has several drawbacks: (1) it is hard or

impossible to find proper reviewers for ‘orphan’ (underdemanded)

papers; (2) the assignment of overdemanded and underdemanded

papers is somewhat arbitrary, and results in additional work for

the PCMs and often low quality reviews; (3) PCMs spend time and

effort bidding on papers that they are unlikely to get, either because

they are overdemanded, or because they already unknowingly bid

on enough papers; (4) program chairs typically spend a lot of time

and effort coping with underdemanded papers.

1.2 A market for reviews
Imagine that instead of the current bidding system, we had a market where papers had prices and reviewers had money. Overdemanded papers would become very expensive, whereas the price of underdemanded papers would become low (or even negative). A reviewer currently holding some expensive (overdemanded) papers, might want to sell it and buy cheap (underdemanded) papers instead. When prices stabilize, papers with few bids will be rare since they will have very low (or negative) price.
Naively applying a market approach to the paper assignment problem may be impractical, as it requires too much interaction among already-busy PCMs. Moreover, the “paper market" differs from other markets in that all PCMs are eventually assigned a similar number of papers, even if they do not bid at all. The lack of quasi-linear utilities (as there is no use of real money) further complicates things.
Most importantly, the assignment may have various constraints and considerations that are difficult to capture formally and handle rigorously. Thus, program chairs are unlikely to adopt a completely new algorithm that may solve some issues but is not tailored for

their needs, and PCMs may be deterred by an interface very different from what they are used to.
1.3 Paper Goal and Contribution
Our goal is to improve paper bidding, which in turn will improve paper assignment. We present a simple paper bidding mechanism called the proportional bidding scheme: PCMs are each assigned some initial budget R they are expected to exhaust, and the price of every paper changes dynamically, inversely proportional to its demand. Then, papers are assigned based on these bids using any ordinary assignment algorithm. That is, we do not aim to replace existing assignment algorithms, but to enhance their input—and thus to improve their output.
In order to compare the suggested bidding scheme to the current one, the main theoretical challenge is to model and analyze bidding incentives, without specifying an explicit assignment algorithm. More specifically, we do the following:
• Define a “mock assignment", as an abstraction that captures the key properties of assignment algorithms and aims at capturing the perceived probability, for a PCM, to be assigned a paper.
• Prove that in the game induced by the proportional bidding scheme and the mock assignment, there is an incentive for PCMs to make sincere bids that match the requested bidding amount R.
• Show via extensive simulations that if bidders are sensitive to price (less likely to bid on cheap, low probability papers) then our bidding scheme obtains socially better outcomes: the bids are more balanced across papers, and PCMs get better papers on average.
A secondary claim that we make is that the price mechanism can make the bidding process easier for some PCMs under the assumption that there is some effort involved in checking one’s own utility for each paper.
We defer most of the longer proofs and some of the simulation results to the appendix.
1.4 Related Work
Assignment Algorithms. A first stream of papers consists of information retrieval approaches to the assignment problem: a paper is considered as a query, and each reviewer is considered as a text document. The aim is to retrieve a certain number of reviewers that are relevant to the paper without asking them to make explicit bids. These (numerous) papers are far from our work and focus; we only cite a recommendation-based approach that aims at easing paper bidding, namely the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) [6]: for each paper j and each reviewer i, a fitness degree is determined by the proximity between j and some of the papers authored by i. The PCM can e.g. sort papers by their fitness degree during the bidding process to facilitate bidding and read fewer abstracts. Our proposal for a bidding scheme is compatible with TPMS or similar systems as well as advances in assignment and matching algorithms. Default bids may be computed taking into account keywords or TPMS score, if one of these is available, and reviewers would then be able to update their bid taking paper prices into account.

Table 1: We recall that m is the number of papers, n the number of PC members, r the number of reviews per paper, k the average number of reviews per PCM, and R (when defined) the bidding target expressed by the program chair (“please bid on at least R papers”). We show the number of papers that received less than r bids, or 0 bids, respectively; we also show the
average number of bids per PCM (respectively paper).

A second stream consists of matching-based approaches. The aim is to find an optimal assignment of papers to reviewers, given the input data. There are two subcategories of work in this area.
In the first subcategory, the input to the assignment is based on keyword or topic overlap: the input data consists of a set of keywords and/or topics for each paper, and for each reviewer. In this category we find Hartvigsen et al. [10], Nguyen et al. [16], Ahmed et al. [1], Long et al. [13], and Conry et al. [7]. The latter two integrate a recommendation stage and a matching stage. Long et al. [13] makes an interesting note echoes our observation from Table 1:
(...) it might happen that some popular reviewers are assigned to excessive papers while some other reviewers with very few or even no papers. (...) In the second subcategory, the assignment is based on bids that PCMs place on papers, as described in step 3 in the process presented in Section 1.1. In this category we find Lian et al. [12], Garg et al. [8], Goldsmith and Sloan [9] (who also consider keyword overlap), and the (unknown) algorithm used by EasyChair.
Bidding Behavior. Very few papers focus on the behavior of bidders within the assignment system. The only empirical work we know of is Rodriguez et al. [18], which analyses the bids of reviewers for a real conference, and studies its correlation with reviewer-paper fit. This fit is measured by a complex combination of techniques involving the co-author network, keyword occurrence, reviewer similarity and submission similarity. They find that the bidding behaviour is only weakly related to the subject of the submission, and that plenty of other (unidentified, conjectured) factors influence the bidding behaviour. They repeat the observation on imbalanced bids, and conclude that
Since bidding is the preliminary component of the manuscript-to-referee matching algorithm, sloppy bidding can have dramatic effects on which referees actually review which submissions.
Game Theory and Mechanism Design. Some papers focus on strategyproof peer review [11, 19]. Especially, [19] consider scenarios where reviewers (who are also authors) may bid strategically so as to influence the assignment. We assume here reviewers bid independently from their interest as authors, but are still self-interested and would like to minimize their effort during both the bidding and reviewing phases. Finally, market approaches (such as using scrip money) have been considered for various allocation problems such

as course allocation [3, 5, 17]). Yet we are unaware of a theoretical or practical application to review assignments.
All of the above points, together with our own observations in the past ten years or so (i.e., since paper bidding has been commonly used), lead to the conclusion that the most effective way to improve the assignment is indeed to improve the input to the assignment algorithms, rather than fine tuning the algorithms themselves. So without further ado, we get to work.

2 PRELIMINARIES

Throughout the paper, we denote the sets of PCMs (reviewers) and
papers by N and M, respectively. Furthermore, we denote by n and m the sizes of these sets, respectively.

Assignments. Each paper j should be ultimately assigned to rj reviewers, and each PCM i should get exactly ki papers for re-

view. Note that for an assignment to be possible, we must assume

i ∈N ki = j ∈M rj .

A valid fractional partial assignment is a non-negative matrix

X = (xij )i ∈N, j ∈M that meets the following constraints:

Capacity constraints most ki papers);

j ∈M xij ≤ ki (every reviewer gets at

Quota constraints ∀i ∈ N , j ∈ M, xij ≤ qij . Typically qij ∈

{0, 1}, where qij = 0 meaning that there is a COI. However

for analysis purposes we allow any nonnegative value.

Paper constraints ∀j ∈ M, i ∈N xij ≤ rj .

Note that the above constraints are met trivially by the empty

assignment. We say that X is full for PCM i if j ∈M xij = ki , and complete if it is full for all PCMs.

For ease of presentation we assume, unless mentioned otherwise,

that rj = r for all j, that r ≥ 1, and that qij ≤ 1 for all i ∈ N , j ∈ M. An assignment is integral if xij ∈ Z for all i, j.

Bids. A (fractional) bidding profile is a real matrix B = (fi j )i ∈N, j ∈M , where fi j ∈ R+ is the bid of PCM i ∈ N on paper j ∈ M. We assume unless explicitly stated otherwise that fij ∈ [0, 1], and we always require fij ≤ qij (in particular, a PCM cannot place
a bid on a paper if she has a conflict of interest with it). The bid of
PCM i is the vector Bi := (fij )j ∈M . A bidding profile B is integral if fij ∈ {0, 1} for all i, j. When bids are integral we sometimes abuse

notation by writing Bi as the subset of papers that PCM i bids on.3 We similarly denote by Dj := (fij )i ∈N the demand profile for paper j (induced by B). In a given profile B, we denote by dj := i ∈N fij the total demand of paper j, and d := (dj )j ∈M .
An assignment algorithm is a function that takes as input a bidding profile B, and outputs a valid partial assignment X . We describe
several assignment algorithms in use in Section 5.

Proportional Bidding Scheme. We describe steps of the bidding scheme we propose. Note that these steps are aligned with the

process outlined in Section 1.1.

(1) For each paper j, the system displays a “price" pj :=

min{1,

r dj

}

(that

is,

inversely

proportional

to

the

demand

of paper j).

(2) Each PCM i that enters the system submits a bid Bi .

(3) The contribution of PCM i in profile B is defined as the to-

tal price of demanded papers. Formally, cpi := j ∈M fijpj .

Crucially, the prices and thus the contribution will depend

on the bidding profile, so they change dynamically as more

PCMs enter or change their bids.

(4) The system may announce (or enforce) a bidding require-
ment R, such that a bid Bi is sufficient in profile B only if cpi ≥ R. A bid Bi that meets the requirement R exactly (i.e. where cpi = R) is called exact.
(5) Like in current bidding systems, reviewers may log in later

on and revise their bid. Unlike current systems, they may

see different prices each time.

(6) Bidding continues until some stopping condition is met, e.g.

all PCMs bid at least once, no bidder wants to revise her bid,

or some deadline has passed.

The output of the bidding mechanism is some final bidding profile B∗. When the bidding phase is over, we run some assignment algorithm A, with B∗ and various allocation constraints as input to get
an assignment.

Remark 1. The price pj that a PCM i sees is always the price as if i is already bidding on paper j, as it should reflect the contribution if
a bid occurs. We demonstrate this in Example 2.1.

papers. We only use integral bids in this example.

• Initially, bids are B1 = {a, b}, B2 = {a, c}, all other bids are

empty. This yields d = (2, 1, 1, 0)

• Reviewer 3 logs in. She sees the prices pa = min{1, |Da ∪r {3} | } = 23 , pb = min{1, |Db ∪r {3} | } =

For simplicity we assume that there is only one level of positive integral bids. We

later explain how to extend analysis and simulations to multiple bid levels.

3 PROPORTIONAL MOCK ASSIGNMENTS

In order to analyze the outcome and the bidding behavior, we

must also take into account the assignment algorithm. However,

since most practical assignment algorithms are based on integer

programming, the connection between input (bids) and output

(assignment) is quite complicated and sensitive to small changes

in the input. Thus a PCM cannot readily use them to derive her

beliefs about her assignment. Moreover, the bid-to-assignment (or

the probability of assignment) connection may be both counter-

intuitive, and requires information not available to the bidder, i.e.,

knowledge of the full bid matrix. Since we are interested in incentive analysis, it is more important to capture the way that PCMs perceive the effect of their actions, especially when the actual effect may

vary considerably across assignment algorithms and may not even

be known, for example, EasyChair does not reveal what algorithm

they use [12].

To make a rigorous theoretical analysis possible, instead of deal-

ing with particular assignment algorithms, we describe a (fractional) mock assignment that captures in an intuitive way the connection between the bid of a single PCM and her assigned papers. Intuitively, the PCM gets more of paper j when bidding positively on j, when the demand for j is lower, and when she bids on fewer other papers. We will further assume that the fractional assignment of paper j to PCM i changes linearly w.r.t. the above factors. This will allow us to single out a unique mock assignment. Whenever we

focus our attention on a particular PCM, we will use the uppercase

index I , keeping i for contexts where multiple PCMs are considered.

In the remainder of this section and the next one, we consider the

assignment from the point of view of a particular PCM I .
We make a distinction between two cases: if cpI > kI we say that I overbids; and if cpI < kI we say that she underbids. If cpI = kI then we say that the bid is exact, and this can be considered both

as a weak overbid or weak underbid.

Similarly, a paper can be either overdemanded (if dj > r ) or underdemanded (if dj < r ). We thus define:

uj := [r − dj ]+, oj := [dj − r ]+.

(1)

Recall that we also defined pj

:=

min{1,

r dj

}, thus overdemanded

papers have price pj = 1.

Definition 3.1 (PMA). XI = (xI j )j ∈M is a proportional mock assignment (PMA) for PCM I w.r.t. input BI = (fI j )j ∈M , qI = (qI j )j ∈M , d = (dj )j ∈M if it is:
full j ∈M xI j = kI ; valid For all j ∈ M, xI j ≤ min{r , qI j }; proportional There is a constant α ≤ 1 such that:
(OB) If the PCM is weakly overbidding, then xI j = α · fI jpj for all j ∈ M;
(UB) If the PCM is weakly underbidding, then xI j = min{qI j , fI jpj + α · uj } for all j ∈ M.

Given an underbidding PMA XI with its constant α, we denote by QI := {j ∈ M : fI jpj + α · uj > qI j } as the set of strictly constrained papers. We similarly define Q˜ I with a weak inequality, see Example 3.4.
A few explanations are in order. If I is overbidding, then the
assignment is simply proportional to bids weighted by paper prices.

A Market-Inspired Bidding Scheme

If I is underbidding, however, an assignment proportional to bids weighted by prices may both violate validity (if α is too large) and fail to be full (if α is too small). In that case, a proportional
assignment will assign first papers for which the reviewer has
placed a bid, weighted by their price, and then completes reviewer i’s assignment by giving her a fraction of underdemanded papers, proportionally to their degree of underdemand uj , while making sure that the quota constraints are not violated.

Existence and uniqueness of PMA. A proportional mock assignment is not guaranteed to exist. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for its existence and prove that in this case it is unique.

Definition 3.2 (Initial assignment). Define xI j := fI jpj as the initial (partial) assignment. We say that X I = (x I j )j ∈M is extendable w.r.t. input (BI , qI , d) if there is a valid and full XI such that xI j ≤ x I j + uj for all j.
The initial partial assignment X I simply assigns each paper proportionally to the bid and the price, and may assign more than kI papers to I . Considering the leftovers uj of all underdemanded papers, assuming extendability means that there is some way to partially allocate these leftovers, so that I obtains a complete and valid assignment.
Extendability can be violated in extreme cases, e.g. if I does not bid at all and still all papers are overdemanded. A sufficient condition extendability is either that I overbids, or that
kI ≤ min{qI j , uj }.
j ∈M
Since kI is bounded by 10-15 and the sum on the right hand side tends to grow linearly with the size of the conference, a violation is highly unlikely in any practical situation.4
Thus, for the rest of the paper on we will assume that extendability holds (for PCM I ).
We next show that a PMA always exists as long as the initial
partial assignment is extendable. Further, in this case the PMA is
unique.

Proposition 3.3. Given bid BI , quotas qI and demands d, there exists a PMA if and only if the initial assignment X I is extendable.

The proof (in Appendix C) is constructive and relies on a simple
algorithm that roughly proceeds as follows: it first computes the initial assignment X I ; then, if I is overbidding then α is a simple normalization factor; if I is underbidding, α is computed in a series of iterations (at most m). The details of the algorithms are relegated to Appendix A. Here we give a small example (the details of how it
is computed by the algorithm are in Appendix B).

Example 3.4 (Proportional Mock Assignment). n = 5, m = 6 (papers are called a, b, c, d, e, f ) r = 2, and all quotas are 1. We use PCMs with different ki for exposition purposes only. The bids fij are shown in Figure 1 (left) and the initial assignment X is shown

on Figure 1 (right).

See Appendix B for the complete exposition of the example.

Note that computing the PMA independently for all PCMs may not result in a valid assignment, as some papers may be allocated less or more than r times (see Appendix B). Yet, from the viewpoint of a particular PCM that does not know the exact bid matrix, or even the assignment algorithm, this is a reasonable abstraction.
Proposition 3.5. Consider input BI = (fI j )j ∈M , qI = (qI j )j ∈M , d = (dj )j ∈M , and suppose that X I is extendable. Then the PMA is unique.
The proof is in Appendix C.
PCMs expect that bidding on a paper would increase the chance of getting this paper. While in actual assignment algorithms there may be corner cases that violate this, we want to show that the PMA does follow this natural expectation, which plays a key role in the game-theoretic analysis.
Definition 3.6 (assignment monotonicity). Consider two bids BI = (fI j )j , BI′ = (fI′j )j for which a (unique) PMA exist, where for some specific j, fI′j < fI j whereas all other bids are the same. An assignment is monotone in bids if for any such BI , BI′, the respective obtained assignments XI , XI′ satisfy: MON1 xI′j ≤ xI j ; MON2 xI′j′ ≥ xI j′ for all j ′ j; That is, PCM I gets no more of paper j and no less of all other papers.
Proposition 3.7. Both the PMA and the initial assignments are monotone in bids. Moreover, for the initial assignment MON1 holds with a strict inequality.
Proposition 3.8. The (unique) PMA is continuous in the bid.
Both proofs are in Appendix C.

4 INCENTIVES
The bidding process can be thought of as a game, where every time
a PCM logs in, she sees the current prices (which reflect current demand) and reacts with her own bid. Given demands d−I , every bid BI induces a PMA XI (as I does not know — and cannot know — the actual assignment), and therefore some expected utility for PCM I . Crucially, we assume that the quotas qI and capacity kI are provided externally, and are not part of the strategy of the PCM.
In order to define this utility, we assign a cost CI j reflecting the inconvenience of reviewing paper j to PCM I . We assume that costs are generic, i.e. no two papers have the same cost. Taking quotas and capacities as fixed, we define
cI (BI , d−I ) := xI jCI j ,
j ∈M
where XI = (xI j )j ∈M is the unique PMA corresponding to bid BI (recall that we assume the initial assignment is extendable and thus
the PMA exists).

Figure 1: Bids (left) an initial assignment (right) in Example 3.4.

A best response of I to d−I is a bid BI such that cI (BI , d−I ) ≤ cI (BI′, d−I ) for all BI′. Note that a best response always exists since the strategy sets are compact.
Given d−I , two bidding strategies BI , BI′ are said to be equivalent if they induce the same PMA, i.e., XI = XI′.
Remark 2. If XI is not full, then the cost is not well defined— presumably, such a PCM will be asked to review some papers outside the assignment mechanism. However recall that we explicitly assume that the initial assignment is extendable to a full assignment, which is sufficient for the existence of a unique PMA (and in particular full).
4.1 Sincere and exact bids
By genericity, I has a strict preference order over papers. We say that a bid BI = (fI j )j ∈M is sincere if there is j ′ such that fI j = 1 for all papers that I prefers over j′, and fI j = 0 for all papers that I prefers less than j′.
Note that a sincere bid can be characterized by a single number bI , meaning that the PCM bids fI j = 1 on her favorite ⌊bI ⌋ papers and bI − ⌊bI ⌋ on the next paper.
Recall that a bid BI = (fI j )j ∈M is exact under prices (pj )j ∈M ,5 if j ∈M fI jpj = kI , that is, the PCM neither overbids nor underbids. Under the genericity assumption, there is a unique sincere exact bid, where bI = kI . We denote the sincere exact bid of I (w.r.t. d−I , qI , kI ) by bI∗. Observation 4.1. If BI is exact, then xI j = fI jpj . In particular, if I places a full bid on paper j (fI j = 1) then xI j = pj , i.e., the price reflects exactly the fraction (or probability) of paper j that PCM I will get if bidding on the paper.
Observation 4.1 suggests that among all exact bids it is always best to be sincere. However, it does not rule out the possibility
that the PCM overbids or underbids to improve the set of allocated
papers. Also, changing the bid also changes the prices so the bid
may not remain exact. Our main theoretical result is that any best response for I is
equivalent to bI∗. The remainder of this section is used to prove this claim in two steps: first we show that any optimal bid is equivalent
to a sincere bid (Prop. 4.2). Then, we show that among sincere bids
it is always better to be exact.
Proposition 4.2. Suppose that BI is a best response, then BI is equivalent to a sincere best response.

Note that the prices are affected by the entire demand, which in turn depends on the bid BI .

Proof. We measure the insincerity of a bid BI as follows. Let j′ = argminj ∈M:fI j <1 CI j and j ′′ = argmaxj ∈M:fI j >0 CI j . If j ′ ≥ j ′′ then I N (BI ) := 0 (bid is sincere). Otherwise, I N (BI ) := j ′′−j ′− fI j′ + fI j′′, We say that strategy Bi′ is more sincere than Bi if I N (Bi′) < I N (BI ).
By continuity, the set of best responses is compact. Thus let BI be a best response with minimal I N (BI ). We argue that I N (BI ) = 0,
otherwise we can construct an equivalent bid that is strictly more

sincere.
By monotonicity, increasing the demand of j′ results in xI′j′ ≥ xI j′, whereas the allocation of all other papers weakly decreases. If xI′j′ = xI j′ then this means BI′ is equivalent to BI but more sincere. Similarly, if we can decrease fI j′′ without affecting xI j′′ we are done.
Thus assume that both modifications result in a strict increase in
xI j′ and a strict decrease in xI j′′.

Case I: PCM is weakly overbidding. Let δ ∈ (0, min{1 − fI j′, fI j′′ }) sufficiently small (will be specified later). Consider the bid BI′ = (fI′j )j ∈M defined by fI′j′ = fI j′ +δ . This is clearly an overbid, which results in a new PMA XI′ with some α ′ = α − ε, where ε = ε(δ ). Since x I′j′ > x I j′ , ε > 0.

By continuity, for small ε there is µ = µ(ε) such that setting

BI′′ := ((fI′j )j j′′ ), fI j′′ − µ) results in a PMA XI′′ with α ′′ = α ′ + ε,

unless ε

is

too

large

(again, α ′′

α′

since

x

j ′′

<

x I j′′ ).

We

thus

set δ > 0 sufficiently small so that µ(ε(δ )) exists, and get α ′′ =

α′ + ε

=

α.

Since

X

′′ Ij

for all j

j′, j′′, and I gets strictly

more of j ′ and strictly less of j ′′, we get cI (BI′′, d−I ) < cI (BI , d−I ), in contradiction to BI being a best response.

Case II: PCM is strictly underbidding. By assumption, setting fI′j′ = fI j′ + δ strictly increases xI j′, and thus α ′ = α − ε where ε = ε(δ ) > 0. Note that this entails that j′ Q˜ I , and thus we can set δ sufficiently small so that j′ Q˜ I′ either. The exact opposite holds for decreasing j′′. What we would want is to do both and keep α at the
same level. However we need to prove that this is possible—that is,
that increasing demand on j′ does not eliminate strict monotonicity
of xI j′′. Indeed, failure of strict monotonicity of xI j′′ occurs either if (a) j′′ is strictly constrained, or if (b) all papers j with positive excess uj (except j′′ itself) are strictly constrained. In all other cases, decreasing fI j′′ increases kI and thus the assignment of some paper j j′′ strictly increases, which entails strict monotonicity.
However, increasing the demand on j′ can only make other papers less constrained, i.e. if j QI then j QI′. The only paper whose positive excess may change by increasing fI j′ is j′ itself, but again this can only decrease uj . Thus if we can set fI′j′′ = fI j′′ − τ

A Market-Inspired Bidding Scheme

to reach α ′′ = α − µ with respect to BI , then we can still reach α ′′ = α ′ − µ (i.e., w.r.t. bid BI′ ) by setting fI′j′′ = fI j′′ − τ ′.

To conclude the proof, we set µ = ε sufficiently small so that

both τ = τ (µ) and δ = δ (ε) exist (and such that j′ Q˜ I′). In the

bid BI′′ = (fI j′ + δ , fI j′′ − τ ′, (fI j )j

that

Thus

as XI

except

cI (BI , d−I ), in contradiction to BI being a best response.

Proposition 4.3. Any best response is equivalent to a sincere and exact bid.

Proof. We start from an arbitrary sincere best response bI ∈ R+.

If bI

is

an

overbid,

then

b

the

cost,

as

long

as

b

′ I

is

still a weak overbid. This is since by proportionality, the fraction of

the least favorite papers in X I is strictly decreasing. Therefore no

best response can be overbidding.

Suppose now that bI is an underbid. Label papers by increasing CI j , and denote by j ′ := argminj ∈M:fI j <1 CI j the first paper with less-than-maximal bid (as in the previous proof). Note that j′ =

⌊bi ⌋

By monotonicity, x1′j′ ≥ xI j′, whereas xI′j ≤ xI j for all other

papers.

the proof, as

cI (bI′ , d −I ) − cI (bI , d −I ) = (xI′ j − xI j )CI j = (xI′ j′ − xI j′ )CI j′ + (xI′ j − xI j )CI j

and Cj > Cj′ for all j > j ′.

Indeed, consider some paper j < j′, and note that fI j = 1. If

pj = 1 then x1j = f1jpj = 1, and this is still the case for x1′j . Then,

since x1j ∈ [x1j , q1j ] = [1, 1], we get x1j = 1 = x1′j .

If pj < 1, then uj = 0 (paper is overdemanded). Also note that

the bid on j has not changed and thus

x 1′ j = f1′jpj′ = f1jpj = x 1j .

Since x1j

4.2 Price-sensitive bids
Consider a bidder facing papers with private costs (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and respective prices (0.6, 0.6, 0.15, 1, 0.6). Suppose the bidding requirement is R = 2, so a sincere strategy would bid either on the first 3 or first 4 papers.
However in practice, inferring a good estimate of one’s own
private cost requires some effort (e.g. reading the paper’s abstract),
whereas the price in our suggested mechanism is presented explic-
itly. Since papers with a low price have low assignment probability,
and also contribute little to meet the bidding requirement, the PCM

GAIW’20, May 2020, Auckland, New Zealand

may skip low-price papers such as paper #3 above, and not consider them for bidding at all (or at least not until she exhausted the high-price papers).
We consider two bidding behaviors that may capture this effect.

Sincere bidding + Costly exploration. Preferring high-price papers may be due to uncertainty on their true cost. Consider a model where for each paper j and PCM I , there is a distribution CI j from which the “true" cost cI j will be realized. During bidding, the PCM can decide to invest some effort, and then observe the realization cI j (e.g. by reading the abstract). For simplicity, suppose that the realization is either 0 or 1, meaning that the paper is a good fit or a bad fit for the reviewer. In that simple case, CI j is the probability of a bad fit.
A myopic PCM would maintain a “current bid" which is optimal
according to known costs (explored or expected), and thus exact
and sincere. Then, the PCM will gradually explore papers until
exploration is no longer beneficial.
Suppose that the current optimal (sincere and exact) bid is some Bi∗, whereas after exploring paper j, the new optimal bid is Bi(j) (which is also sincere, but according to the revealed cost).
Each paper has some “exploration effort" ej , and some marginal exploration gain mдj := ci (Bi(j), d−i ) − ci (Bi∗, d−i ). The optimal bidding policy is clearly to explore the paper maximizing mдj − ej as long as this value is positive, and submit bid Bi∗ once all papers yield non-positive improvement.
We argue that papers with a higher price should be explored
earlier, ceteris paribus, and thus the PCM is likely to skip more
low-price papers.

Proposition 4.4. The marginal gain mдj is weakly increasing in pj .

Proof. Denote by G the set of all explored papers that turn out

to be good, i.e. with a known cost of 0. The optimal bid is to bid

on papers from G, and on unexplored paper in increasing order of
CI j ,until the bidding requirement is reached: j ∈M fI jpj = kI . Note that since agent I bids are always exact, she receives under
the PMA a fraction of fI jpj of each paper j. To maintain an exact bid, if she increases fj then she has to decrease her bids on other

papers (by sincerity, on the ones with the largest expected cost).

Denote by z the worst paper with nonzero bid. Note that fI j = 1 for all j < z and fI j = 0 for all j > z (we assume here that papers are

ordered by non decreasing expected costs). There are three cases

when exploring the next paper j:

• fI j = 0. That is, j is not in the current bidding set at all. In this case, with probability CI j the paper turns out to be bad , i.e. CI j = 1, and the bid does not change. With probability 1−CI j

the paper turns out to be good. Then it is added to the bidding set (fI′j = 1) and pushes out of the bidding set a fraction pj of the highest-cost papers (possibly including other 0-cost

papers). Denote by y(F ) the total cost of the F most costly

papers

= y(pj ).

Then

the marginal gain when exploring j is mдj = (1 − CI j )y(pj ),

which is monotonically increasing in pj .

• fI j = 1. That is, j < z is in the current bidding set. With

probability 1 − CI j the paper turns out to be good, the bid

GAIW’20, May 2020, Auckland, New Zealand

does not change, and the expected cost (after receiving a new
information on paper j) becomes cI (BI∗, d−I ) − F · CI j . With probability CI j the paper turns out to be bad and is removed from the bidding set, making room for the an F fraction of

the least costly papers that are not in the bidding set. In this

case,

pj

is

eliminated

Now

denote

by

yˆ(F ) the total cost of these papers, then the cost of the new

bidding set is

cI (BI∗, d−I ) − pj · CI j + yˆ(pj ) = cI (BI∗, d−I ) + F (yˆ(ppjj ) − CI j ).

In total

mдj = cI (BI∗, d −I ) − ECI j [cI (BI(j ), d −I )] = −(1 − CI j )(−pj · CI j ) − CI j F ( yˆp(pjj ) − CI j )

yˆ (pj )

yˆ (pj )

= pj · CI j ((1 − CI j ) + (CI j − pj )) = F CI j (1 − pj )

Therefore

∂pj = CI j − CI j ∂F ≥ CI j (1 − 1) = 0,

as required, since

∂yˆ(F ) ∂F

1.

• j = z. We analyze the marginal gain as a sum of two explo-

ration actions: the last paper in the bidding set with price

pj fI j ; and the first paper outside the set with price pj (1− fI j ). Since both parts are non-decreasing in pj we get the result

from linearity of expectation.

□

That is, cost-wise, it is better to explore papers close to the decision threshold (high-cost in the bidding set or low-cost out of the set), and for two papers with a similar uncertainty over their cost, it is better to explore first the one with the higher price.

Greedy price-sensitive bidding. The “attractiveness" of each paper is some function that is increasing (linearly) in price and decreasing (linearly) in private cost. The bidder selects papers greedily by decreasing attractiveness, until reaching the bidding quota.
The greedy heuristic is easy to apply and similar to how a rational decision maker would behave under quasi-linear utilities, or in other contexts of selecting multiple items [4].

4.3 Multiple bid levels
It is both a conceptual and technical question whether a “strong bid"
should be considered differently when computing papers’ prices. The technical part is easy: we may allow fij to take any nonneg-
ative value. Thus a PCM i that bids fij = 2 will get in the initial assignment twice the amount of paper j than bidder i ′ that bids fi′j = 1, at any given price. PCM i also contributes more to the demand.
As for incentive analysis, note that if multi-level bids are allowed,
then the PMA is still well defined with slight modifications (we
need to make sure that the initial assignment does not violate the
quota). Then following almost the same proofs shows that bidders
still have an incentive to be sincere, in the sense that they will give the maximal possible bid on some t most preferred papers, and 0 bid on all papers after t + 1. The proofs for exact bids also remain almost.

In practice, various considerations may guide the decision of the bid strength, such as how competent the PCM believe they are for this particular review.
4.4 Dynamics and Equilibrium
A behavior of bidder i is a mapping from a profile B and private costs Ci to a new bid Bi′. A profile B is an equilibrium if for all i ∈ N , Bi is a best response to d−I (note that d−I is induced by B).
Increasing Bids. We say that a sequence of bidding profiles B0, . . . , BT is weakly increasing if fitj+1 ≥ fitj for all i ∈ N , j ∈ M,t < T.
One way to justify increasing bids is that reviewers rarely bother to eliminate an existing bid. For the rational behavior we can also deduce this from the properties of the best-response strategy:
Observation 4.5. If in Bt all bidders are sincere and weakly underbid, and some set of bidders N ′ ⊆ N update their bids by playing an exact sincere bid, then:
(1) fitj+1 ≥ fitj for all i ∈ N ′, j ∈ M, and all other bids remain unchanged;
(2) all prices weakly decrease in Bt+1; (3) all bidders are sincere and weakly underbid in Bt+1.
Therefore, if the initial bid is sincere and below the bidding requirement (e.g. the empty profile) then by induction the bidding sequence is weakly increasing. Such a bidding sequence must converge to an equilibrium since bids are bounded. In particular, an equilibrium exists (recall that this is contingent on our assumption that a PMA always exists).
5 IN-SILICO EXPERIMENTS
For space all experiments are in the Appendix.
6 DISCUSSION
In this paper we propose a simple alternative bidding mechanism for reviewers in conferences: for every paper, the reviewers observe a dynamic “price” that reflects the paper’s demand and updates throughout the bidding process. We showed via the introduction of a stylized assignment that changes linearly with the bids (the PMA), that bidders have an incentive to follow instructions and sincerely bid on their favorite papers until they reach the bidding requirement (in terms of overall price of papers).
Interestingly, sincere bidding is not socially favorable. In contrast, a very simple greedy behavior—where reviewers are less likely to bid on cheap (overdemanded) papers—is cognitively plausible, reduces the effort during bidding, and substantially improves the allocation under a broad range of conditions.
Our suggestions can be very easily implemented in existing conference management platforms such as EasyChair and ConfMaster, and allow reviewers to obtain a more preferred lot of papers for less effort. Crucially, we show that the improvement is gradual, and there is no harm if some of the reviewers ignore paper prices altogether and just bid as they are used to.
Privacy and bias. One possible concern is that information on the demand may bias the judgment of the PCMs, or that authors may be unhappy with showing information about the popularity of their

A Market-Inspired Bidding Scheme
paper. We argue that these concerns are unjustified. First, there
is no obvious connection between paper popularity and quality,
as PCMs may bid on a paper either because it is relevant to their
specific interests, because it looks attractive, or because it seems
to be an easy reject(see also Rodriguez et al. [18]). Second, the de-
mand information is shown at a very crude accuracy: the PCM only
observes some arbitrary snapshot, and even then cannot differentiate e.g. a paper with 0 bids from a paper with r bids. Adding the uniform bootstrap (as we do in the simulations and recommend
doing also in practice) demand makes any such inference even less
likely, especially if we add some noise to it. Finally and perhaps
most importantly, unpopular papers are not damaged by reveal-
ing information on their demand. On a contrary, they are more
likely to get suitable reviewers in our suggested bidding scheme,
whereas in the current system the paper will end up with a possibly
disappointed PCM how did not ask for it.
Next steps. We are currently designing lab experiments that will help us understand the actual paper-bidding behavior of people with
and without prices. We also plan a field experiment in a medium-
size workshop where part of the program committee will bid via
the suggested bidding scheme.

Intuitively, we can think of pj as the portion (or probability) that a bidder putting a full bid (fij = 1) on j will get from j in step IA .
The more complicated case is when I is underbidding. Then we allocate unassigned papers to I , but need to be careful to respect quota and capacity constraints. Step UB repeatedly tries to allocate
the remaining papers as follows: first, allocate the maximal possible amount of constrained papers j ∈ Q; then, for any j ∈ M \ Q, allocate the leftovers of paper j (an amount of uj ) proportionally to the available space that the PCM has (denoted by kI ). As long as some papers exceed their quota, the algorithm adds them to Q and repeats the process.
Of course, real assignment algorithms have to deal with fully
allocating all papers, and in particular re-allocate excess papers
from overloaded bidders (even if these papers are overdemanded).
Computing the PMA independently for all PCMs may not result in
a valid assignment, as some papers may be allocated less or more

than r times. Yet, from the viewpoint of a particular PCM that does not know the exact bid matrix, or even the assignment algorithm, this is a reasonable abstraction.

B PROPORTIONAL MOCK ASSIGNMENT: COMPLETE EXAMPLE
We give here full details about how the PMA works on Example 3.4. Recall that n = 5, m = 6 (papers are called a, b, c, d, e, f ) r = 2, all quotas are 1, and the bids are as follows (left):

If we gather all mock assignments to the five PCMs we find that the number of PCMs assigned to a, b, c, d, e and f are respectively 1.85, 1.88, 1.91, 2.25, 2.11 and 1.98, which shows that the individual mock assignments are not globally consistent.

C PROOFS
Proposition 3.3. Given bid BI , quotas qI and demands d, there exists a PMA if and only if the initial assignment X I is extendable.
Moreover, Algorithm 1 always outputs a valid and proportional assignment. If the initial assignment X I is extendable. Then the output is also full, and thus a PMA. In particular, the set of weakly
constrained papers Q˜ I is the set Q that Alg. 1 reaches in the last iteration.

GAIW’20, May 2020, Auckland, New Zealand

Proof. First note that the algorithm must terminate since at

least one new item is added to Q at each step.

Note that proportionality holds by construction, as the algorithm

uses the same α for all papers, namely the value of α at the last

iteration.

For validity, note that for any paper j, at most r is allocated

since zj

=

uj ·k I η

≤ uj . If I is underbidding, then xI j

≤ qI j by

construction. If I is overbidding, note that fI j ≤ qI j and pj ≤ 1,

so Step IA does not violate the quota. Step OB only reduces the

allocation.

It is left to show that the output assignment XI = (xI j )j ∈M is
full whenever X I is extendable. If I is overbidding then

xI j = xI j kI = kI

xI j = kI .

j ∈M

j ∈M kI + obI kI + obI j ∈M

If I is underbidding, then first we can see that allocation does
not exceed kI . Let xI j obtained in the last iteration of the algorithm. Because this is the last iteration, Q+ = ∅, i.e., x I j + αuj ≤ qI j holds for all j ∈ M \ Q.

Further, if the inequality is strict, this means that kI > j ∈M\Q uj . Let XˆI be an arbitrary extension of X I (in particular valid and full), then for all j ∈ M, xˆI j ≤ x I j + uj . Also, since XˆI is valid, xˆI j ≤ qI j .

which means that XˆI is not full, in contradiction to our assumption

that X I is extendable.

□

Proposition 3.5. Consider input BI = (fI j )j ∈M , (qI j )j ∈M , (dj )j ∈M , and suppose that X I is extendable. Then the PMA is unique.

Proof. For overbidders this is obvious, as any change in α will violate the full requirement.

Recall that Q˜ I = {j ∈ M : fI jpj +α ·uj ≥ qI j } is the set of weakly

Proposition 3.7. Both the PMA and the initial assignments are monotone in bids. Moreover, for the initial assignment MON1 holds with a strict inequality.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we prove for j = 1. Denote

then

Without

loss

of

generality,

by

continuity of the Step IA allocation, we may assume that PCM I is

either weakly overbidding in both BI , BI′, or weakly underbidding

in both.6 We similarly assume that either paper 1 is weakly overde-

manded in both bids (d1 > d ′ ≥ r ), or weakly underdemanded in

1

both (r ≥ d1 > d ′).

where the inequality is since

as long as a

and since fI 1 ≤ r < d1 Next consider r > d1 > d1′, then p1′ = p1 = 1

and fI′1p1′ = fI 1 − δ < fI 1 = fI 1p1.

In either case, we have

x I′1 = fI′1p1′ < fI 1p1 = x I 1.

For all j

we

This

shows

that

Step

is monotone.

We are going to consider separately the case where the PCM is

overbidding and the case where the PCM is underbidding. Note that

since a PMA is full, MON2 entails MON1, and thus it is sufficient

to prove MON2. PCM is overbidding in both BI , BI′: i.e., obI > obI′ ≥ 0 holds.
We have that for all j 1,

xI′j = x I′j kI +kIobI′ = x I j kI +kIobI′ > x I j kI +kIobI = xI j . (3)

Note that

We argue that α ′ ≥ α. Otherwise, assume by contradiction, that

α ′ < α holds. By the full property and by proportionality of the

PMA,

kI = xI j = min{qI j , x I j + αuj } + min{qI 1, x I 1 + αu1},

j ∈M

and

kI = xI′j = min{qI j , x I j + α ′uj } + min{qI 1, x I 1 − ε + α ′u1′ }

j ∈M

j1

= min{qI j , x I j + α ′uj } < min{qI j , x I j + αuj } = kI

j ∈M

j ∈M

which is a contradiction. The strict inequality in the last line is
since there must be unconstrained papers for which α applies, or else α ′ = α vacuously. Therefore, for all j 1,

xI′j = min{qI j , x I j + α ′uj ) ≥ min{qI j , x I j + αuj ) = xI j , showing MON2 (and thus MON1).
□

Proposition 3.8. The (unique) PMA is continuous in the bid.

Proof. The prices and thus the initial assignment X I change continuously with the demand. Therefore α must change continu-
ously when I is overbidding, and also when I is underbidding as

long as the set of constrained papers remains the same. We only

need to verify that α does not change abruptly when a new paper

becomes constrained.

This occurs exactly when qI j = x I j + αuj for some paper j,
w.l.o.g. paper 1, i.e., 1 ∈ Q˜ I \QI . Suppose first that paper 1 is treated as unconstrained (1 Q˜ I ).Then since the PMA is full, α is such that

qj +

(x I j + αuj ) = kI .

j ∈Q˜ I

j ∈M \Q˜ I

If we treat paper 1 as unconstrained (Q˜ I′ := Q˜ I \ {1}), then again to obtain a full assignment, α ′ is such that

kI = qj+

(x I j +α ′uj ) = qj +

(x I j +α ′uj )+(x I 1+α ′u1).

We therefore have that:

j ∈(M \Q˜ I )∪{1}

Then either j ∈(M\Q˜ I )∪{1} uj = 0, in which case α is meaningless

(no excess papers to allocate), or α ′ = α, as required.

D EMPIRICAL RESULTS
In order to test the effect of price-based bidding, we simulated PCMs that interact with a bidding system. The PCMs observe dynamic paper prices and bid in turn. To keep simulations as realistic as possible, we used bidding data from real conferences to generate PCMs’ costs and behaviors.
The hypothesis we want to verify is that price-based bidding results in a better bidding matrix (with bids being more balanced across papers, and in particular, less underdemanded papers), which in turn leads to a better assignment, both from the point of view of reviewers (reviewer costs are lower) and papers (fewer papers are assigned to some PCM who did not bid for them – which suggests that papers are better reviewed).

D.1 Setup
Datasets. We use all 5 bidding datasets available on PrefLib [14, 15] (marked DS1-DS5). In addition, we used 3 random samples in
varying proportions from the AAAI’17 bidding dataset (marked DSA1-DSA3). In all datasets, we use r = 3. Every bid in the input has up to three levels, that can be interpreted as “strong bid", “weak
bid", and “no bid".

Private Costs. From each instance (original bid matrix) in Table 2 we derived a cost matrix and a quota matrix as follows. For papers with COI we set qij = 0 and otherwise qij = 1.7 For the other papers, we generated costs in the ranges [0, 1] for strong bid, [1, 2] for a weak bid, and [2, 8] for a no bid, so a stronger bid in the input file always indicates a higher preference. As these ranges are somewhat arbitrary, we also present metrics that are independent of the numerical costs.
Bidding scheme and PCM behavior. Recall that R is the bidding requirement for each PCM. We use integral bids since this is more realistic. In the fixed bidding scheme, we considered the following PCM behaviors. All use integral bids. original The PCM bids exactly as in the original PrefLib file. uniform The PCM bids on the R papers with lowest cost. In the price bidding scheme, we let any PCM bid exactly once, in random order. Since as long as there are few bidders the demands are too low to induce an informative price, we use a “virtual bootstrap
7
We did not have the COI of AAAI’17.

k
bid": every PCM starts with a virtual bid of m on each paper, which entails an initial demand of exactly r for each paper. This virtual bid is replaced by her real bid when she acts. We update the prices every 5 bids.8
We also use the greedy price-sensitive behavior analyzed in Section 4.2: greedy The PCM bids on papers in increasing (Cij − β · pj ) order,
until their cumulative price reaches or exceeds R. Unless specified otherwise, we use β = 2. All behaviors only decide whether to bid positively or not. COI declarations are identical to what they are in the original PrefLib file. When the PCM chooses to bid on a paper, the strength of the bid (needed for the assignment algorithm) is the same as in the original PrefLib file. For the Uniform and Greedy behaviors, we also varied the bidding requirement R. We emphasize that the bid strength was used only for calculating the final assignments. The demands and prices during the bidding process considered every positive bid as 1.

Evaluation. To evaluate the benefit of the proportional price scheme, we simulated different PCM behaviors using the same private costs generated from the datasets above. We then used standard assignment algorithms to match the papers. Following Garg et al. [8] as well as Lian et al. [12] and implementations from Aziz et al. [2] we used the following algorithms which have been proposed in the literature for discrete allocation. The Utilitarian and Rank Maximal algorithm have been used in real conference assignment (it is most likely that the Utilitarian algorithm is used by EasyChair, one of the largest conference management website; see footnote in Lian et al. [12]). We highlight that our PMA plays no role in the empirical evaluation and was used only for analysis purposes. Utilitarian. The Utilitarian assignment algorithm takes a set of
bids and returns the assignment that maximizes the sum of bids (utilities) of the papers assigned to each PCM. Egalitarian. The Egalitarian assignment algorithm takes a set of bids and returns the assignment that maximizes the sum of bids (utility) of the least well-off PCM. Rank Maximal. The Rank Maximal assignment algorithm ignores the value of the bids of the PCMs and only considers the ordinal rankings of the PCMs. It returns an assignment such that for each PCM i, the assignment Xi maximizes the lowest ranked paper received. This mechanism was studied and highly advocated for by Garg et al. [8].

Our results show that findings are similar across different assign-

ment algorithms, we thus present the results mainly for the Util-
itarian algorithm. Since assignments are always in {0, 1}, we use Xi ⊆ M to denote the set of papers assigned to i. Recall also that Bi = {j ∈ M : fij > 0}.
Having the assignment X , we measure how good it is using three
metrics:

Social Cost The average cost to a PCM. Formally,

1 n

i ∈N

j ∈M Cijxij ;

Varying the number of rounds between price updates had almost no effect on the results.

≥ 10 bids 49 14 15 91 155 47 36 16

Fraction of fulfilled bids The average (across PCMs) of |X|iB∩iB| i | . A low number indicates the PCM failed to obtain many of her requested papers.
Fraction of assigned papers w/o bid The average (across
|Xi \Bi |
PCMs) of |Xi | . A high number indicates that the PCM was assigned many papers she did not bid for.
The first metric is the simplest but is sensitive to the way we generated to private costs. The latter two metrics (that are complementary to each other) can be thought of as recall and false discovery rate (complement of precision), respectively. The third one is particularly important, since papers with missing bids are assigned essentially at random, and therefore substantially decrease the review quality and will perhaps require manual re-assignment in practice. We repeated the process 5-20 times and calculated the average of each evaluation metric.
D.2 Results
Social cost. Table 3 compares the social cost obtained under the Original bidding behavior, with the social cost obtained under the proportional price scheme with the greedy behavior. It can be clearly seen that the latter substantially reduces the social cost, especially for the large datasets. In fact the only dataset where this is not true is the DS2, which is both tiny and has no problem of orphan papers in the first place (see Table 2).
We next turn to study what contributes to the improvement in the assignment.
Recall-precision tradeoff. A major factor that affects the assignment is the total number of bids. We therefore compared the Greedy behavior to the Uniform behavior, while varying the bidding requirement R in both. On Figure 2 we can see that, as expected, increasing the bidding requirement results in a lower fraction of assigned papers without bid (higher precision), and a lower fraction of fulfilled bids (lower recall).

More importantly, the graphs highlight the benefits of the proportional price scheme. First, the recall and precision under the greedy behavior are substantially better than under the uniform behavior. Second, this is obtained with much fewer bids and thus presumably less effort on behalf of the PCM. Finally, in the current (no price) bidding scheme, it is difficult to decide how to set the requirement R, or predict how PCMs will conform, whether in the price scheme, setting R = k is useful as a reasonable anchor.
Sensitivity to behavior. Since we cannot control the behavior of the PCMs, it is important to check that the results are not too sensitive to small changes in the behavior. We therefore varied the parameter β in the greedy behavior (recall that higher β means the PCM will lean more towards ignoring low-price papers), as well as the fraction of PCMs who comply with the price-scheme bidding instructions (non-compliant PCMs follow the Original behavior).
We can see that the quality of assignment gradually improves as the sensitivity to prices (Figure 3, left) increase. This pattern means, perhaps counter-intuitively, that strictly following a sincere behavior (where β = 0) is not ideal from a social perspective, as it requires to bid on medium-ranked-but-highly-demanded papers that are likely to fit better some other PCM.
As for the compliance rate, as more PCMs switch to greedy bids the assignment improves in general (Figure 3, middle and right), but we can also see in the right figure that this only slightly hurts PCMs who choose to ignore the prices altogether, as can be seen from the very shallow increase in the cost for original PCMs.
E ADDITIONAL EMPIRICAL RESULTS
In this appendix we further show that our empirical findings are consistent across datasets and assignment algorithms.
Figures 4 and 5 show the recall and precision under both schemes for different bidding requirements. Results are similar to what we see in the main text.

The bottom figures show the assignments with the Rank-Maximal algorithm.

Figure 3: On the left, the effect of varying the parameter β in the greedy behavior (see labels on bullets). On the two right figures, we see the effect of increasing the compliance rate. The bullet labels in the middle figure (and the X-axis in the right figure) show the fraction of PCMs who follow the greedy behavior.

Figure 4: The tradeoff curves of the Egalitarian assignment for DS1 and DSA1. The number above each bullet is the average number of bids per PCM.
