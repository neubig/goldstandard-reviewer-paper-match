ABSTRACT
With the use of common signaling methods for dual-function radarcommunications (DFRC) systems, the susceptibility of eavesdropping on messages aimed at legitimate users has worsened. For DFRC systems, the radar target may act as an eavesdropper (ED) that receives a high-energy signal thereby leading to additional challenges. Unlike prior works, we consider a multicast multi-antenna DFRC system with multiple EDs. We then propose a physical layer design approach to maximize the secrecy rate by installing intelligent reﬂecting surfaces in the radar channels. Our optimization of multiple ED multicast multi-antenna DFRC secrecy rate (OptM3Sec) approach solves this highly nonconvex problem with respect to the precoding matrices. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our algorithm in maximizing the secrecy rate in this DFRC setup.

1. INTRODUCTION
With the advent of mobile communications, portions of spectrum earlier solely assigned to radar are being re-allocated for dual-use with communications [1]. This has accelerated efforts to allow uncontested joint access to the bandwidth through coexisting radar and communications systems, apart from other emitters within the same RF spectrum [2]. In this context, dual-function radar-communications (DFRC) systems have emerged as a viable and relatively less contentious approach because it hosts both transmissions on the same hardware unit using same frequency band [3]. Since DFRC employs an identical waveform for both services, the delivery of information to both communications users and radar targets has increased chances of unauthorized users or eavesdroppers (EDs) intercepting it [4]. In this paper, we focus on secure DFRC transmission.
In general, cryptographic techniques are effective for secure transmission [5]. However, with the computational power available today, it is possible to break cryptographic codes [6]. A complementary approach lies in ensuring physical layer security so that EDs are not able to decode the message successfully, even if they knew the secret code. The physical layer secrecy seeks to maximize, by exploiting channel conditions, the rate of reliable information delivery to the intended receiver, with the ED being kept as ignorant of that information as possible. This line of research was pioneered by Wyner [7], who introduced the wiretap channel and the notion of secrecy capacity, i.e., the rate at which the legitimate receiver correctly decodes the source message, while an ED obtains no useful information about the source signal. For the classical source-destination-ED Gaussian wiretap channel, the secrecy capacity is zero when the quality of legitimate channel is worse than eavesdropping channel [8]. One way

to achieve non-zero secrecy rates is to adopt cooperative jamming by introducing one [9–12] or more [13–17] relays (helpers), which transmit artiﬁcial noise in a beamforming fashion thereby acting as jammers for the purpose of degrading the channel to the ED. Alternatively, the source may embed artiﬁcial noise in its transmission and beamformed it not to interfere with the legitimate receiver [18, 19].
In a DFRC system, the radar target is illuminated by a high-energy signal, which also contains information intended for the communication users. This increases the susceptibility of eavesdropping on the communications messages and may be aggravated when DFRC employs multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas [20] because of its omnidirectional radiation pattern. Recent studies show that physical layer security could be a promising solution for a secure MIMO DFRC [21] by trading-off the secrecy rate (the achievable difference between the communication rates to the legitimate users and the target) for the data rate. The MIMO communications-radar system presented in [22] simultaneously transmitted jamming and communications messages to confuse an ED (co-located with the targets) while trying to enhance target detection. In [20], the MIMO DFRC employed artiﬁcial noise and minimized the signal-to-interferenceand-noise ratio (SINR) at the eavesdropping target with an SINR constraint at the legitimate users. These systems were extended in [23] by incorporating an intelligent reﬂecting surface (IRS) in the channel. An IRS is a two-dimensional surface consisting of a large number of passive meta-material elements to reﬂect the incoming signal through a pre-computed phase shift [24]. The IRSs have emerged as feasible low cost, light-weight, and compact alternatives to large arrays for both communications [25, 26] and radar [27].
Prior works on IRS-aided MIMO DFRC secrecy assume a single ED/target with either unicast or broadcast transmissions. Further, the indirect path of target backscatter via IRS is often ignored in these studies [22, 23]. In this paper, we generalize the DFRC interception problem to optimizing multiple ED multicast multi-antenna secrecy rate (OptM3Sec). Our physical layer design approach maximizes the secrecy rate while meeting power constraints and maintaining a certain SINR for each radar target. In particular, we control the SINR at the radar target (ED SINR) by embedding in the transmit waveform a noise-like signal. The signal and the noise are precoded separately at the radar. We consider both direct and indirect (via IRS) paths for line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) targets. We solve the resulting optimization problem with respect to the precoding matrices following the strategy adopted from [23].
2. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a DFRC system comprising a MIMO radar, L legitimate multi-antenna communications users, an IRS, and K targets which are also EDs with multiple antennas (Fig. 1). Assume that the MIMO radar has NT transmit and receive antennas, each legitimate user is

equipped with NR receive antennas, and each ED rece√ive ante√nna array has NE elements. The IRS is equipped with a N × N

square array of reﬂecting units. A number of channels in this DFRC

system are of our interest. Denote the channel gain matrix for the

channel from radar to k-th target and back to the radar as

Hrtr,k = βkaR(θk)aT (θk)T ∈ CNT ×NT ,

(1)

where βk is the complex reﬂectivity that depends on the atmospheric attenuation and target’s radar cross-section (RCS), θk is the azimuthal location of the target with respect to the radar, aT (θk) (aR(θk)) is the transmit (receive) steering vector of k-th target deﬁned as

where dr is the spacing between the antenna elements at the radar
and λ is the transmit signal wavelength. Similarly, denote the other channel matrices as Hri ∈ CN×N for radar-IRS; Hru,l ∈ CNR×NT for radar-user; Hre,k ∈ CNE×NT for radar-ED; Hiu,l ∈ CNR×N for IRS-user; Hit,k ∈ C1×N for IRS-target; Hie,k ∈ CNE×N for IRS-ED; Hir ∈ CNT ×N for IRS-radar; and Hti,k ∈ CN×1 for
target-IRS paths.
The radar transmits information bearing signal m(t) ∈ CK×1 and artiﬁcial noise (AN) s(t) ∼ CN (0, I) ∈ CK×1 for jointly
detecting the target and communicating with users. The AN is added
to prevent targets eavesdropping on the information transmitted to the users. The transmit signal x(t) ∈ CNT ×1 from the radar is

x(t) = Wm(t) + Bs(t),

(2)

where W = [w1, w2, · · · , wK ] ∈ CNT ×K is the precoding matrix for information and B = [b1, b2, · · · , bK ] ∈ CNT ×K is the
precoding matrix for the artiﬁcial noise.

Assume τ(·),k and ω(·),k are the range-time delay and Doppler shift corresponding to the target k for a given channel (denoted by the ﬁrst subscript), the continuous-time received signal at the radar is:

where nT ∼ CN (0, σT2 I) is the additive white Gaussian noise. The received signal from the radar-IRS-target-IRS-radar path is ignored here because it is much weaker and delayed than the other returns.

The received signal at the k-th ED is: zk(t) = Hre(Wm(t − τre,k) + Bs(t − τre,k))ejωre,kt

where nE,k(t) ∼ CN (0, σE2 ,kI) is the noise at the k-th ED. The received signal at the l-th user is:

where αk is the path attenuation, φk is the direction of the radar from

ED’s reference, and aE,k(φk) is the receive steering vector at target

The channel matrix between radar and i-th legitimate receiver is Fi. Our goal is to determine the optimal precoding matrices W and
B that maximize the secrecy rate and target detection [22]. Typical physical layer methods unrealistically assume that the channel to the ED is known. However, in the DFRC scenario, one could detect all the targets and estimate their channels. Thus, all but the legitimate receiver are classiﬁed as EDs with known channels.

3. MULTICAST WITH MULTIPLE EDS

Assume that the received signal at the radar r(t) is compensated for

time delays and Doppler shifts and processed with matched ﬁlters

corresponding to different targets [28]. The targets are sufﬁciently far

apart so as not to interfere with each other’s responses. We partition

the targets into two sets D and I, such that |D| + |I| = K, for which

only direct and indirect paths are available, respectively.

The signal returning via the IRS is delayed and very weak. There-

fore, it can be neglected if the direct path is available. Denote

Hdc,k = Hrtr,k as the direct path channel for the k-th target, k ∈ D.

Then, the SINR corresponding to the k-th target with beamformer

weights wk and bk is

Tr(Hdc,kwkwkH HHdc,k) + Tr(Hdc,kbkbHk HHdc,k)

SINRdc,k =

σ2

,

T

k ∈ D. (6)

However, if there is an obstacle in the direct path, then the direct path is ignored and we consider the following deﬁnition for targets k ∈ I:

Tr(Hin,kwkwkH HHin,k) + Tr(Hin,kbkbHk HHin,k)

SINRin,k =

σ2

,

T

k ∈ I, (7)

where Hin,k = HirΦHti,kHit,kΦHri,k is the channel gain for the
indirect path for the k-th target. From received signal zk(t) at the k-th ED, its rate is

Re,k = log det I + σE2 ,kI + GkBBH GHk −1 GkWWH GHk .
(8) In the multicast setting, the radar transmits a common message m to all the users. Let Fl denote the channel matrix between the radar and user l, ml(t) denote the message for the l-th user, l = 1, 2, · · · , L

and m(t) = [m1(t), m2(t), · · · , mK (t)]T . The received signal at the l-th user is

yl(t) = Fi(Wm(t) + Bs(t)) + nl(t)

(9)

where nl ∼ CN (0, σl2I) is the receiver noise. Hence, the rate at the l-th user is [29]

−1

Ru,l = log det I + σR2 ,lI + FlBBH FHi

FlWWH FHl .

(10) The secrecy rate is maximized by solving the optimization problem:

maximize minimize [Ru,l − Re,k]+

subject to Tr(BBH ) + Tr(WWH ) ≤ P,

Tr(Hdc,kwkwkH HHdc,k) + Tr(Hdc,kbkbHk HHdc,k) ≥ γk, k ∈ D,

Tr(Hin,kwkwkH HHin,k) + Tr(Hin,kbkbHk HHin,k) ≥ γk, k ∈ I,

(11)

where P denotes the transmit power constraint and γk denotes the SINR threshold for target k.
4. SECRECY RATE MAXIMIZATION

In order to solve (12), our OptM3Sec algorithm follows a three-step approach as in [23]. However, unlike [23], our algorithm updates W and B through a nonconvex optimization problem, whose nonconvex feasible region is convexiﬁed via linearization of the SNR constraints. Further,the optimization over Φ is highly nonconvex in our problem and, therefore we use a speciﬁc version of stochastic gradient ascent as opposed to the semideﬁnite relaxation in [23]. Our algorithm consists of the following steps.

Optimizing over auxiliary matrices: Rewrite (11) as

maximize λ W,B

subject to Tr(BBH ) + Tr(WWH ) ≤ P,

Tr(Hdc,kwkwkH HHdc,k) + Tr(Hdc,kbkbHk HHdc,k) ≥ γk, k ∈ D,

Tr(Hin,kwkwkH HHin,k) + Tr(Hin,kbkbHk HHin,k) ≥ γk, k ∈ I,

Ru,l − Re,k ≥ λ ≥ 0 ∀l, k.

(12)

After some tedious algebra, we obtain

Ru,l − Re,k = log det I + FlWWH FHl

It follows from [30, Lemma 4.1] that

G1 = max (log det(Wb) − Tr(WbEb(Ub, W, B))) Wb 0,Ub + constant,

where Wb, Ub are auxialiary matrices of appropriate dimensions, and Eb(Ub, W, B) =. (I − UbH FlW )(I − UbH FlW )H +UbH σR2 ,lI + FlBBH FHi Ub.

The optimal solution (Wb∗,l,k, Ub∗,l,k) is
Ub∗,l,k = arg max (log det(Wb) − Tr(WbEb(Ub, W, B)))
Ub
= (σR2 ,lI + FlBBH FHl + FlW W H FlH )−1FlW , (14)

and

Wb∗,l,k = (Eb(U∗b,l,k, W, B))−1.

(15)

Similarly, we use auxiliary matrices We, Ue to deﬁne

G2 = max (log det(We) − Tr(WeEe(Ue, B)))+constant, We 0,Ue

where

Ee(Ue, B) =.

and

We∗,l,k = (Ee(U∗e,l,k, B))−1.

(18)

Similarly, deﬁne

G3 = max (log det(Wz) − Tr(WzEz(W, B))) + constant, Wz 0

and Wz∗,l,k = I + σE21,k GkBBH GHk + σE21,k GkWWH GHk . Deﬁne T =. {Ub, Wb, Ue, We, Wz, W , B, Φ} as the collection of all unknown parameters. We solve (12) using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method.

Optimizing over (W, B) given Φ: Here, the SNR and se-
crecy rate constraints in (12) lead to a non-convex feasible re-
gion. The secrecy rate constraint can be convexiﬁed by (19). We
linearize the SNR constraints by ﬁrst-order Taylor series approximation around some initial approximations w˜ k and b˜k. Deﬁne fdc(wk, bk) = Tr(Hdc,kwkwkH HHdc,k) + Tr(Hdc,kbkbHk HHdc,k). Then,

fdc(wk, bk) ≈ fdc(w˜ k, b˜k)+Re(∇Twk,bk fdc(w˜ k, b˜k)(dk −d˜k)),

where dk = [wkT bTk ]T , ∇wk,bk fdc = [ ∂∂wfdTkHc

2wkH Hdc,kHHdc,k, and ∂∂fbdH kc = 2bHk Hdc,kHHdc,k. This yields

fdc(w˜ k, b˜k) + Re(∇Twk,bk fdc(w˜ k, b˜k)(dk − d˜k)) ≥ γk, k ∈ D,

fin(w˜ k, b˜k) + Re(∇Twk,bk fin(w˜ k, b˜k)(dk − d˜k)) ≥ γk, k ∈ I,

Ru,l − Re,k ≥ λ ≥ 0 ∀l, k.

This convex optimization problem is solved by any standard solver.

Optimizing Φ for given W , B: The SNR constraint for the direct
radar-target-radar links and the secrecy rates in (12) do not depend on Φ. Denote h(Φ) = Hin,kwkwkH HHin,k + Hin,kbkbHk HHin,k. This results in the following optimization problem

stochastic approximation (SPSA) [31], which is a speciﬁc version of stochastic gradient ascent. In SPSA, we iteratively update Φ˜ (t). In the t-th iteration, a zero-mean perturbation vector ∆(t) ∈ RN×1
is generated independently, where each of its entries {∆i(t) : 1 ≤
i ≤ N } is chosen from the set {−1, 1} with equal probability. Then the iterate Φ˜ (t) is perturbed in two opposite directions as Φ˜ +(t) =. Φ˜ (t) + c(t)∆(t) and Φ˜ −(t) =. Φ˜ (t) − c(t)∆(t). Next, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N , the i-th component of Φ˜ (t) is updated as

f˜(Φ˜ +(t)) − f˜(Φ˜ −(t))

φi(t + 1) = φi(t) + a(t) ×

and the iterates are projected onto the interval [0, π] to ensure fea-

sibility. The positive step size sequences {a(t)}t≥1 and {c(t)}t≥1

need to satisfy the following conditions: (i) ∞ t=1 a(t) = ∞, (ii)

5. EXPERIMENTS AND SUMMARY
We validated out proposed method through numerical experiments. We considered a system with a single IRS, a radar, two multiple antenna receivers. We set NT = 4 for radar transmit and receive antennas, NR = 4 for user receive antennas, and NE = 4 receive antennas for each ED. The IRS is equipped with N = 10 array of reﬂecting units. We consider two attack scenarios for our simulations, the ﬁrst being when the attack is performed by an single ED and the second when the attack is done by two EDs. In the ﬁrst attack setup we consider the target’s true directions with respect to the radar as θ1 = 72◦ and from the reference of two EDs, the radar is located at φ1 = −85◦. In the second scenario the target’s true directions with respect to the radar are θ1 = 72◦ and θ2 = 78◦. From the reference of two EDs, the radar is located at φ1 = −85◦ and φ2 = −88◦. The RCS coefﬁcient and path loss variables are set as α1 = 0.1, α2 = 0.1, β1 = 0.1, and β2 = 0.1. The variances of all Gaussian noise variables are set to unity.
For all channels involved, we sampled each channel coefﬁcient from an independent circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance of unity. Fig 2 shows that in presence of a single ED, with our OptM3Sec algorithm, the secrecy rate increases with the maximum transmit power P compared to the case when there is no IRS present. It is also evident from Fig 2 that in presence of two EDs, the secrecy rate also increases with the maximum transmit power P , however it can be observed that due to the increase in the number of EDs there is a slight decrease in the secrecy rate which is very intuitive. The above results highlight the signiﬁcance of IRS in secrecy rate performance for multicast IRS-aided MIMO DFRC system with multiple EDs.
