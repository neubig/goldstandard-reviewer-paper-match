Abstract—In this paper, we introduce a new attack called controller manipulation attack (CMA) on a Reconﬁgurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) assisted communication system between a transmitter and a receiver. An attacker has the potential to manipulate the RIS controller and modify the phase shift induced by the RIS elements. The goal of the attacker is to minimize the data rate at the receiver, subject to a constraint on the attack detection probability at the receiver. We consider two different attack detection models: (i) composite hypothesis testing based attack detection in a given fading block for known channel gains, and (ii) SNR moment based detection over possibly multiple fading blocks. In the ﬁrst case, a simple energy detector turns out to be uniformly most powerful (UMP) and the attack against this energy detector is designed via a novel optimization formulation and a semideﬁnite relaxation based solution. In the second case, we consider threshold detection using moments of SNR; various SNR moments under no attack are obtained analytically for large RIS and then used to formulate the attack design problem as a linear program. Finally, numerical results illustrate the performance and trade-offs associated with the attack schemes, and also demonstrate their efﬁcacy.

I. INTRODUCTION
The last two decades have seen tremendous activities towards developing techniques that exploit the inherent randomness of the wireless propagation medium. Such research efforts traditionally focused on optimizing the transmission and reception schemes. Reconﬁgurable metasurfaces have shown the potential to be useful as a tool for controlling the wireless propagation medium. Certain electromagnetic properties of these surfaces can be electronically controlled, which helps in their use in passive beamforming for wireless communication without using additional transmit antennas and RF chains. Some well-known implementations of RIS include reﬂect arrays and software deﬁned metasurfaces [1]– [5], and this technology is envisioned to play a key role in 6G communications.
The RIS consists of multiple reﬂecting elements; and phase shift induced at each element can be controlled by an RIS micro-controller; see Figure 1. By simultaneously adjusting the phase shifts of all elements, the RIS can fully control the strength and direction of the reﬂected electromagnetic waves. Active transmit beamforming at the transmitter and passive reﬂect beamforming at the RIS can be used to optimise performance, such as transmit power reduction and energy efﬁciency maximisation [6], [7].

Meanwhile, physical layer security has been intensively explored as a counterpart to upper layer encryption approaches for safeguarding wireless security. A signiﬁcant number of such works focus on enhancing the secrecy performance against a eavesdropper; e.g., [8] that combines transmit beamforming with artiﬁcial noise in an RIS based setup, [9] and [10] for using RIS to maximise the secrecy rate, and [11] for lowering the base station transmit power using RIS under a secrecy rate constraint. Wireless transmissions are also subject to jamming attacks; a traditional jammer uses its own energy source to broadcast powerful noise signals to the victim node. However, the authors of [12] suggested an RIS based jammer that makes use of the signal of victim system. Another attack is pilot contamination attack (PCA), where the pilot sequence is manipulated by a eavesdropper using RIS, leading to incorrect channel state information at the transmitter and consequently signiﬁcant signal leakage to the eavesdropper during the succeeding data transmission phase; see [13]. On the other hand, false data injection (FDI) attack [14]–[16] is a potential threat to networked control systems, where the data ﬂowing in the system is manipulated by an external stealthy attacker to disrupt the estimation and control operations.
In this paper, we propose a new physical layer attack called controller manipulation attack (CMA) on RIS-assisted communication, where an external attacker can manipulate the phase shift induced by the RIS during the data transmission phase. In spirit, CMA is a combination of PCA and FDI; unlike PCA, CMA works on the data and not on the pilot symbols, and unlike FDI, CMA operates at the physical layer. CMA can be carried by an attacker that can either hack the RIS microcontroller or infect it by a malware. As seen later in the paper, CMA results in signiﬁcant throughput loss to the communication system.
The goal of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for design of stealth CMA. We summarise our major contributions as follows:
1) We propose the CMA attack for the ﬁrst time, and provide its mathematical model.

2) For the case where the multiple received data symbols in a single fading block are used to detect CMA, we show that a simple energy detector is uniformly most powerful (UMP). In the process, we discover a certain interesting relation between the received signal variance, false alarm probability and attack detection probability.
3) The energy detector is leveraged to formulate an optimization problem for attack design to minimize the received signal to noise ratio (SNR) subject to detection constraint. This non-convex problem is converted to a rank-constrained optimization problem, which is sub-optimally solved via a combination of semideﬁnite relaxation and Gaussaian randomization.
4) For detection over multiple fading blocks, we assume known channel only to the attacker; the detector at the receiver employs a threshold based detection rule on the difference between the empirical SNR moments and the SNR moments under no attack. The attacker’s problem is shown to be a linear program. In the process, we derive closed form expressions of the moment generating function and the ﬁrst and second order moments of the received SNR under no attack.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider a wireless communication system where a

single antenna transmitter (Tx) communicates with a single

antenna receiver (Rx) and is assisted by an RIS consisting

of N elements. A ﬂat fading model is assumed for all the

channels involved. Furthermore, we assume that the line-

of-sight (LOS) path is not present between the transmitter

and receiver due to severe blockage, and the signals that

are reﬂected from the RIS more than once have negligible

strength [6]. We denote the channel between the transmitter

and the kth RIS element by hk, whereas the channel between the kth RIS element and the receiver is denoted by gk. We

g˜k ∼ CN (0, 1), and h, g represent the corresponding path losses. Let hk = αkejθk gk = βkejψk where αk = |hk|

and βk = |gk| represent the channel amplitudes following

Rayleigh distribution, while θk and ψk are the equivalent

channel phases, uniformly distributed between [0, 2π]. Let the phase shift induced by the kth RIS element be

φk .

by

a

matrix

Φ = diag([ejφ1 , . . . , ejφN ]), and let Ω = [φ1, φ2 . . . , φN ]T

be a vector consisting of the corresponding RIS phase shifts.

The baseband signal at the receiver is given by [18]:

√N

y = P gkejφk hkx + w

(1)

k=1

Here x ∼ CN (0, 1) represents the transmitted signal drawn

from a Gaussian codebook, P denotes the transmit power,

and w ∼ CN (0, σw2 ) denotes the additive white Gaussian noise

(AWGN) at the receiver. We can equivalently write (1) as [19]:

√

y = P gHΦhx + w

(2)

where h =. [h1, h2 . . . hN ]H and g =. [g1, g2 . . . gN ]H. Let Λk =. φk + ψk + θk.

The received SNR can be expressed as Γ = κ¯ |gHΦh|2 where κ¯ =. P/σ2 , which can further be rewritten as:

Γ = κ¯ αkβk exp (j [φk + ψk + θk])

We consider two phase shift models:

Continuous phase shift model: Here, the RIS elements are

able to generate any arbitrary phase shift between [0, 2π]. If the

phase shifts generated by the combined propagation channel

through the RIS is accurately known, the reﬂector phases

of each element are adjusted by the RIS microcontroller to

achieve zero phase errors. Obviously, when the RIS sets its

phases

is achieved ∗

at

the

receiver. We denote Φ0 = diag([ejφ1 , . . . , ejφN ]) as a matrix

corresponding to the optimum phase shifts at the RIS.

Discrete phase shift model: Here the RIS elements are able
to realise only a ﬁnite, discrete set of phase shifts. Typically,
for each element, the collection of possible phase shifts is
given by D = {0, ∆φ, . . . , ∆φ(M − 1)}, where ∆φ = 2π/M and M = 2b for b ∈ Z+; see [7], [17]. Let φˆk ∈ D be the phase shift induced by the kth element of the RIS. We deﬁne the quantization error for the kth element as δk = φˆk − φk∗, where φ∗k is the optimum phase shift under the continuous phase shift model. Since the Rayleigh fading channel gains gk
and hk are independent across k, and the elements in D are
spaced in regular intervals, δk is independently and uniformly distributed in (−τ, τ ], where τ = π/2b.

We consider two scenarios for the attacker who adversarially controls Ω in order to hamper the communication. In the ﬁrst scenario, attack detection is carried out by the receiver in each fading block at a much faster timescale, and, taking this into account, the attacker seeks to minimise the data rate; see Section III. Here the channel gains are assumed to be known to the attacker and the detector. In the second scenario, attack detection is carried out over multiple fading blocks or at a much slower timescale, and the attacker seeks to minimise the ergodic data rate at the receiver; see Section IV.

III. ATTACK FOR A GIVEN FADING BLOCK

In this section, we assume that the receiver and the attacker

have perfect knowledge of the channel gains {hk, gk}1≤k≤N

over a quasi-static ﬂat fading block under consideration, and

P = 1. The transmitted symbols are drawn from a Gaussian

as the received signal

variances under attack and under no attack, respectively. We

consider continuous phase shift model in this section.

Lemma 1. σ2 ≤ σ02 if Φ = Φ0. Equality holds if Φ = Φ0.

Proof. See Appendix A

Theorem 1 provides an intuition that any non-optimal phase
shift at the RIS results in a smaller signal variance than the
optimal case; this observation crucially helps in designing the CMA detector. However, it has to be noted that {φk∗ + c}1≤k≤N for any constant c also maximizes the variance of

y, and hence we consider solutions with Λk = 0 ∀1 ≤ k ≤ N without loss of generality.
A. Attack detection via hypothesis testing
We formulate the detection problem as a binary hypothesis testing problem. Let us assume that K symbols are transmitted over a fading block, and the receiver detects a possible CMA at the end of the fading block. The two hypotheses are:

H0 : Φ = Φ0 H1 : Φ = Φ0

Clearly, the null hypothesis means that there is no attack, and
the alternate hypothesis implies an attack. Since the receiver receives K i.i.d observations {yi}1≤i≤K in a fading block, where yi ∼ CN (0, σ2), the two hypotheses can be equivalently represented as:

H0 : σ = σ0 H1 : σ < σ0

Lemma 2. The optimum likelihood ratio test reduces to

K
.

H1 2

W = ||yi|| η

(4)

i=1

H0

where η > 0 is a threshold.

Proof. See Appendix B

In Lemma 2, we observe that the likelihood ratio test simpliﬁes to an energy detector; when the received signal power (or SNR) is low, the detector declares an attack.
Lemma 3. If yi ∼ CN (0, σ˜2) for any σ˜ > 0, then 2λW follows the Chi-squared distribution (χ2 distribution) with 2K degrees of freedom, where λ = σ˜12 and W =. Ki=1 ||yi||2.
Proof. See Appendix C

The probability of false alarm (PFA) is deﬁned as, PF A = P(W ≤ η |H0). Lemma 3 helps us in deriving PF A of the detector and thus helps in attack design. Let ρ represent the signiﬁcance level of a test and R2K,ρ denote the inverse cumulative distribution function of the chi-squared probability density function (PDF) with 2K degrees of freedom, evaluated at a probability ρ ∈ [0, 1].

Theorem 1. The likelihood ratio test described in Lemma 2 is a Universally Most Powerful (UMP) test with a threshold η = R2K,ρσ02.
Proof. See Appendix D

B. Designing the attack against the UMP detector
Now we design an attack strategy against the UMP test, assuming that the attacker has knowledge of the threshold η . The probability of detection (PD) can be written as follows:

PD = P(2λW ≤ 2λη |H1)

(5)

From the perspective of an attacker, we seek to ﬁnd an optimum σ2 which is realizable via RIS phase shift, minimizes the data rate at the receiver, and achieves a low detection probability.

Theorem 2. The value of σ2 for a particular probability of detection ξ and a known threshold determined by ρ as per Theorem 1 is given by σ2 = R2K,ρσ02 .
R2K,ξ

Proof. See Appendix E

Theorem 2 helps us in ﬁnding σ2 for a given detection probability ξ. Also, the detection probability decreases as σ2 increases (i.e., as |σ02 − σ2| decreases), since it becomes more difﬁcult to distinguish between the two hypotheses. Theorem 2
can be used by an attacker to calculate the phase shift vector Ω. However, any arbitrary σ2 may not be realizable by Ω. Hence, given that SN R = |gHσΦw2 h|2 , we consider the following optimization problem instead:

min log(1 + SN R) s.t. PD ≤ ξ

(6)

Ω

1) Procedure to ﬁnd the attack phase shift vector: Since

PD ≤ ξ can be simpliﬁed using Theorem 2 as σ2 ≥ RR2K2K,ρ,σξ 02

or |gH Φh|2 ≥ R2K,ρσ02 − σ2 =. ν, and since log(·) is an

R2K,ξ

w

increasing function, we can alternatively write (6) as follows:

min |gH Φh|2

Ω

(7)

s.t. |gH Φh|2 ≥ ν; 0 ≤ φk ≤ 2π, 1 ≤ k ≤ N

Let s = [s1, s2 . . . sN ]H where sk = ejφk . We denote Ψ = diag(gH )h, hence we have |gH Φh|2 = sH ΨΨH s. Thus, (7)

can be written as:

min sH ΨΨH s

s

(8)

s.t. |sk| = 1, 1 ≤k ≤ N ; sH ΨΨH s ≥ ν

We observe that (8) is a non-convex optimization problem, ΨΨH 0
hence we use an auxiliary matrix L = 0 0 and an
s auxiliary vector s¯ = 1 to tackle this issue. We can further write s¯H Ls¯ = Tr(Ls¯s¯H) = Tr(LS), where S = s¯s¯H and
needs to fulﬁll S 0 and rank(S) = 1. We can reformulate
(8) as follows:

min Tr(LS)
S

s.t. Sk,k = 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ N + 1

(9)

S 0, rank(S) = 1, Tr(LS) ≥ ν

We note that in (9), the rank one constraint makes the problem

non-convex. We apply semideﬁnite relaxation (SDR) to relax

the rank-one constraint:

min Tr(LS)
S
s.t. Sk,k = 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ N + 1; S

(10) 0, Tr(LS) ≥ ν

Clearly, (10) is a convex semideﬁnite program (SDP [20]) and hence can be solved using solvers such as CVX [21]. However, the solution obtained is not necessarily rank-one and hence yields a lower-bound to the objective in (9). Hence, we proceed to create a rank-one solution by following the process of Gaussian randomization [6], [12]. We can write the eigenvalue decomposition of S as S = QΣQH where Q = [q1, q2, . . . , qN+1] is a matrix consisting of eigenvectors of S and Σ = diag(λ¯1, λ¯2, . . . , λ¯N+1) is a diagonal matrix consisting of corresponding eigenvalues. We can write a sub-

√ optimal solution to (9) as s¯ = Q Σf¯, here f¯ denotes a random vector which is independently generated from CN (0, IN+1). Finally, a candidate solution to (7) is given by:

s¯

Ω = arg

(11)

s¯(N + 1) (1:N)

where s¯(N + 1) denotes the N + 1 th element of s¯ and [s]1:N represents the ﬁrst N elements of the vector s. Hence, by using (11), a candidate value of Ω is obtained. However, if this candidate Ω does not satisfy all constraints in (7), then this solution is discarded. By generating a large number of i.i.d. samples for f¯ and evaluating only the feasible ones, we can determine the best s which satisﬁes the constraints in (8) with high probability; obviously, this is a sub-optimal solution with high precision [22]. The entire mechanism is summarised in Algorithm 1.

Output: Ω. 1: Solve (10) and derive the value of S. 2: for e = 1, 2, 3, . . . , E do 3: Sample f¯(e) from CN (0, IN+1). 4: Compute Ω(e) using (11). 5: If Ω(e) is a feasible solution of (7), evaluate the objective function of (7) at Ω(e). 6: end for 7: Find best feasible solution from {Ω(e)}1≤e≤E for (7).

IV. ATTACK OVER MULTIPLE FADING BLOCKS
In this section, we design the attack under the discrete phase shift model, though a similar treatment is possible for the continuous phase shift model as well. We assume that the fading in the wireless links is fast and i.i.d. Rayleigh across fading blocks. The detector at the receiver collects {y1, y2, · · · , yT } over T fading blocks, using which it has to decide whether an attack has occurred or not. If the detector knows the channel gains at each time, then it can simply employ an energy detector as in Section III, and the theory for attack detection and design remains unchanged, subject to some scaling operations. However, in this section, we assume that the attacker knows {hk, gk}1≤k≤N in each fading block, but the receiver does not know it. Hence, the detector seeks to check whether the empirical distribution of SNR over T fading blocks match with the SNR distribution under no attack. This can be done by performing a goodness-of-ﬁt test, but we consider a simpler detector that only compares a few empirical moments of received SNR with their desired values; this helps in restricting the number of constraints in the optimization problem of the attacker in Section IV-B. After receiving {y1, y2, · · · , yT }, the detector computes the empirical moments of SNR, denoted by SNˆ Rl (for the lth moment), and declares that an attack has happened if and only if |SNˆ Rl − SN¯ Rl| ≥ ζl, where ζl represents a threshold and SN¯ Rl denotes the lth moment of SNR under no attack. This condition can be checked for multiple values of l. In this paper, we focus only on l = 1, 2, though our results can be extended

for any l. In Section IV-A, we ﬁrst derive SN¯ Rl in closed form for both continuous and discrete phase shift models, which is later used in Section IV-B for attack design.
A. Moments of SNR under no attack

Let us consider Rayleigh channels as discussed in Section II,

and deﬁne the moment generating function (M.G.F) of SNR

Γ∗ as MΓ∗ (t) = E(etΓ∗ ). The lth moment of SNR is SN¯ Rl =

Using Theorem 4 we can ﬁnd out any moment of SNR under the discrete phase shift model.

B. Attack design: optimization problem formulation
Let s be a typical state of the attacker, which consists of the instantaneous channel gains {hk, gk}1≤k≤N available to the attacker. However, we discretize the state space to obtain a ﬁnite number of states. A generic action a of the attacker is a vector of phase shifts [φˆ1, . . . , φˆN ] ∈ DN ; the attacker takes an action in each fading block. The signal to noise ratio under a state-action pair is denoted by SN R(s, a), and this can be computed by the attacker using (3). Moreover, SN¯ Rl can be calculated by an attacker using either Theorem 4 for large N or by brute-force computation for small N . The attacker seeks to minimise the ergodic data rate at the receiver while roughly preserving the moments of SNR.
Let π(s) denote the probability of occurrence of channel state s. We consider probabilistic action selection by the RIS at each time; let p(a|s) denote the probability of choosing action a under state s on part of the attacker. The attacker seeks to minimize the ergodic data rate at the receiver, while preserving the moments of the received SNR. The attacker’s problem can be cast as the following optimization problem:

min
p(a|s)∀a,s

π(s) p(a|s) log(1 + SN R(s, a))

s.t. p(a|s) ≥ 0 ∀a, s; p(a|s) = 1 ∀s (13)

Let us consider m actions and n states. We denote

p =. [p1, . . . , pk, . . . , pn]T , where pk =. [π(sk)1m]T , and

1m is an all-1 column vector of dimension m × 1. Let x =.

[x1, . . . , xk, . . . , xn]T , where xk =. [p(a1|sk), . . . , p(am|sk)].

Also, C

diag([t1, . . . , tk, . . . , tn]) where

tk = [SN R(sk, a1), . . . , SN R(sk, am)], K =.

diag([u1, . . . , uk, . . . , un]) where uk

=

[log(1 + .

SN R(sk, a1)), . . . , log(1 + SN R(sk, am))], and R = C2.

The optimization problem (13) can be rewritten as a linear

optimization problem as follows:

min pT Kx
x

s.t. x ≥ 0, Ax = 1n×1,

(14)

pT Cx ≤ SN¯ R1 + ζ1, pT Cx ≥ SN¯ R1 − ζ1

pT Rx ≤ SN¯ R2 + ζ2, pT Rx ≥ SN¯ R2 − ζ2

The matrix A is a logical matrix used to represent the constraint a p(a|s) = 1 ∀s, and its entries are chosen accordingly. This linear program can be solved by using
traditional solvers, and its solution can be used by the attacker.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
We consider a Rayleigh fading model, i.e., hk, gk ∼ CN (0, 1). We also consider P = 30 dBm, σw2 = −10 dBm.
UMP test over a given fading block: We consider N = 64 and K = 50, and evaluate the performance of the proposed

attack scheme over 10000 independently generated channel realizations. For various false alarm rates, we evaluate the threshold (η ) and use it to ﬁnd σ2 for a given probability of detection. Further, using Algorithm 1, we ﬁnd out the optimum phase shift matrix (Ω) and employ it to attack the generated instances. Fig 2 shows that, as the probability of detection is increased, the attacker can decrease the data rate by a considerably large value which is also intuitive. Additionally, we observe that as the probability of false alarm increases for a ﬁxed detection probability, the percentage decrease in data rate also reduces. This is due to the fact that, as the false alarm increases, the detector becomes more cautious and this leaves limited opportunity for the attacker to reduce the data rate.
SNR based detector over multiple fading blocks: We consider an RIS with N = 8 and four possible phase shifts (b = 2). All results are averaged over 100 independent channel realizations. Table I shows that less stringent constraints result in more reduction in the ergodic data rate.
However, it is important to note that, the number of variables in (13) is 2bN . This necessitates development of low complexity algorithms for large N .

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have analytically designed controller manipulation attack against UMP energy detector over a single fading block and SNR based detector over multiple fading blocks. In the ﬁrst case, a higher detection tolerance of the attacker enables it to cause more harm to the received data rate. Also, for the SNR based detection over multiple fading blocks, higher detection tolerance results in a much reduced ergodic data rate. In future, we will develop low complexity attack schemes for multiple fading blocks.

Obviously, σ2 achieves the maximum variance σ02 only if Λk = 0 for all 1 ≤ k ≤ N , i.e., if Φ = Φ0.

APPENDIX C

PROOF OF LEMMA 3

Let yi ∼ CN (0, σ˜2) for any arbitrary σ˜2 > 0. Now, ||yi||2 = YR2 + YI 2, where YR and YI are real and imaginary parts of

yi. Obviously, YR ∼ N (0, σ˜2/2), YI ∼ N (0, σ˜2/2). Since YR2 and YI 2 are chi-squared distributed random variables

with one degree of freedom, hence ||yi||2 is an exponentially

distributed random variable with parameter λ

=

[23,

Chapter 6, Equation 6-68]. Now, W =.

is

a

sum of K exponentially distributed random variables and as

K is an integer, hence the sum (W ) generalizes to Erlang

distribution with parameters as K and λ [23, Chapter 7,

Equation 7-165]. We deﬁne the characteristic function (c.f.)

ϕU (r) of any random variable U as the Fourier transform of

its probability density function fU (u), expressed as ϕU (r) = E eirU = eirufU (u)du. We can write the c.f. of W as ϕW (r) = E ReirW = (1−1ir )K . Representing, D = 2λW
λ
we can write its c.f. as: ϕD(r) = E eirD = E eir2λW .

Let r = 2λr, hence ϕD(r) = E eir W =

the

a

random variable with 2K degrees of freedom [23, Chapter 5,

Table 5-2]. Hence, 2λW is a chi-squared random variable with

2K degrees of freedom.

APPENDIX D PROOF OF THEOREM 1 From Lemma 2, we obtain:
PF A = P(W ≤ η |H0) = P(2λ0W ≤ η |H0) = ρ (15)

where λ0 = 1/σ02 and η = 2λ0η . Using (15), the detector chooses the threshold (η ) based on a required probability of
false alarm (ρ). We have η = R2K,ρ and hence the threshold η = η /2λ0 is independent of the value of the parameter σ2 (and Φ) and the test is UMP.

APPENDIX E PROOF OF THEOREM 2

We are given that ξ = P(2λW ≤ 2λη |H1). Now, we know that 2λη = R2K,ξ, where λ = 1/σ2 and η = R22λK0,ρ . This yields:

R2K,ρ = R2K,ξ

2λ0

2λ

=⇒ R2K,ρσ02 = R2K,ξσ2

=⇒ σ2 = R2K,ρσ02 (16) R2K,ξ

APPENDIX F PROOF OF THEOREM 3

Note that, αk and βk are independent Rayleigh distributed
random variables and Xk = αkβk. Also, E(Xk) = µx = √ h g π4 and V ar(Xk) = σx2 = h g(1 − π162 ) [24]. By applying Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for large N we have:

ΞN

Hence, for large N , we can write the mean and variance of

Z as µz = N √ h g π4 and σz2 = N h g(1 − π162 ). Also, since

SNR (Γ∗)=κ¯|

N k=1

the

SNR

follows

a

non-

Hence, we can write its P.D.F as:

APPENDIX G

PROOF OF THEOREM 4

Let us deﬁne V =. 1
N

N k=1

Vk

,

where

Vk

=

αkβkejδk .

We observe that as the distribution of δk is symmetric around

the origin, and hence its characteristic function ϕδk (ω) is always real. Hence, µ = E(Vk) = E(αk)E(βk)E(ejδk ) = π4 √ h gϕδk (1). Similarly, variance υ = h g(1− π162 |ϕδk (1)|2) and pseudo-variance ρˆ = h g(ϕδk (2) − π162 ϕδk (1)2) [23,
Chapter 7, Page 249]. Obviously, µ, υ, ρˆ ∈ R. By applying

central limit theorem, for large N we can approximate the

distribution of V

as

CN

(µ,

υ N

,

ρˆ N

).

Let

VR

and VI

denote the

real and imaginary parts of V , respectively. We can write:

1

υ ρˆ

Cov(VR, VI ) = 2 Im(− N + N ) = 0. (17)

Since VR and VI are jointly Gaussian and uncorrelated, they are mutually independent. Also, VR ∼ N (µVR , σV2R ) and VI ∼ N (0, σV2I ), where µVR = µ and

σV2R = 12 Re( Nυ + Nρˆ ) = 2hNg (1+ϕδk (2)− π82 ϕδk (1)2) (18)

σV2I = 12 Re( Nυ − Nρˆ ) = 2hNg (1 − ϕδk (2)) (19)

By using the results derived in [25, Theorem 1, Appendix B]

and [26] we can approximate the distribution of |V |2 (for large

µ2V

N)

as

a

gamma

distribution

with

shape

kV 2

=

and scale parameter as θV 2 = 4σV2R . From (12) we write the

SNR as Γ∗ = κ¯N 2|V |2. After rewriting, we obtain Γ∗ =

|V |2, where = κ¯N 2 and > 0. Hence, we can infer from

above that as |V |2 follows gamma distribution hence the SNR

also follows a gamma distribution with shape parameter as

kΓ∗ = kV 2 and scale parameter as θΓ∗ = θV 2 . As a result,

we can write the PDF of SNR as:

Hence, the M.G.F of |V |2 is M|V |2 (t) =

(1 − tθ|V |2 )−k|V |2 , ∀t < θ|V1|2 where θ|V1|2 =

Further, the M.G.F of SNR Γ∗ can be expressed as

MΓ∗ (t) = (1 − t θ|V |2 )−k|V |2 . [23, Chapter 5, Table 5-2].

The lth moment of SNR is given by:

SN¯ Rl = E Γ∗l = MΓ(l∗)(0) = dldMtlΓ∗
