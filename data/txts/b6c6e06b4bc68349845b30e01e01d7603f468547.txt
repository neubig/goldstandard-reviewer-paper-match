Abstract—We use information theoretic achievable rate formulas for the multi-relay channel to study the problem of optimal placement of relay nodes along the straight line joining a source node and a sink node. The achievable rate formulas that we use are for full-duplex radios at the relays and decodeand-forward relaying. For the single relay case, and individual power constraints at the source node and the relay node, we provide explicit formulas for the optimal relay location and the optimal power allocation to the source-relay channel, for the exponential and the power-law path-loss channel models. For the multiple relay case, we consider exponential path-loss and a total power constraint over the source and the relays, and derive an optimization problem, the solution of which provides the optimal relay locations. Numerical results suggest that at low attenuation the relays are mostly clustered close to the source in order to be able to cooperate among themselves, whereas at high attenuation they are uniformly placed and work as repeaters.
The structure of the optimal power allocation for a given placement of the nodes, then motivates us to formulate the problem of impromptu (“as-you-go") placement of relays along a line of exponentially distributed length, with exponential pathloss, so as to minimize a cost function that is additive over hops. The hop cost trades off a capacity limiting term, motivated from the optimal power allocation solution, against the cost of adding a relay node. We formulate the problem as a total cost Markov decision process, for which we prove results for the value function, and provide insights into the placement policy via numerical exploration.
I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless interconnection of mobile user devices (such as smart phones or mobile computers) or wireless sensors to the wireline communication infrastructure is an important requirement. These are battery operated, resource constrained devices. Hence, due to the physical placement of these devices, or due to the channel conditions, a direct one-hop link to

the infrastructure “base-station” might not be feasible. In such situations, other nodes could serve as relays in order to realize a multi-hop path between the source device and the infrastructure. In the cellular context, these relays might themselves be other users’ devices. In the wireless sensor network context, the relays could be other wireless sensors or battery operated radio routers deployed speciﬁcally as relays. In either case, the relays are also resource constrained and a cost might be involved in engaging or placing them. Hence, there arises the problem of optimal relay placement. Such an optimal relay placement problem involves the joint optimization of node placement and of the operation of the resulting network, where by “operation" we mean activities such as transmission scheduling, power allocation, and channel coding.
In this paper we consider the problem of maximizing the data rate between a source node and a sink by means of optimally placing relay nodes on the line segment joining the source and the sink; see Figure 1. More speciﬁcally, we consider the two scenarios where the length L of the line in Figure 1 is known, and where L is an unknown random variable whose distribution is known, the latter being motivated by recent interest in problems of “as-you-go" deployment of wireless networks in emergency situations (see Section I-A, Related Work). In order to understand the fundamental tradeoffs involved in such problems, we consider an information theoretic model. For a placement of the relay nodes along the line and allocation of transmission powers to these relays, we model the “quality" of communication between the source and the sink by the information theoretic achievable rate of the relay channel1. The relays are equipped with full-

duplex radios2, and carry out decode-and-forward relaying. We consider scalar, memoryless, time-invariant, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Since we work in the information theoretic framework, we also assume synchronous operation across all transmitters and receivers. A path-loss model is important for our study, and we consider both powerlaw and exponential path-loss models.
A. Related Work
A formulation of the problem of relay placement requires a model of the wireless network at the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers. Most researchers have adopted the link scheduling and interference model, i.e., a scheduling algorithm determines radio resource allocation (channel and power) and interference is treated as noise (see [4]). But node placement for throughput maximization with this model is intractable because the optimal throughput is obtained by ﬁrst solving for the optimum schedule assuming ﬁxed node locations, followed by an optimization over those locations. Hence, with such a model, there appears to be little work on the problem of jointly optimizing the relay node placement and the transmission schedule. In [5], the authors considered placing a set of nodes in an existing network such that certain network utility (e.g., total transmit power) is optimized subject to a set of linear constraints on link rates. They posed the problem as one of geometric programming assuming exponential path-loss, and showed that it can be solved in a distributed fashion. To the best of our knowledge, there appears to be no other work which considers joint optimization of link scheduling and node placement using the link scheduling model.
On the other hand, an information theoretic model for a wireless network often provides a closed-form expression for the channel capacity, or at least an achievable rate region. These results are asymptotic, and make idealized assumptions such as full-duplex radios, perfect interference cancellation, etc., but provide algebraic expressions that can be used to formulate tractable optimization problems. The results from these formulations can provide useful insights. In the context of optimal relay placement, some researchers have already exploited this approach. For example, Thakur et al. in [6] report on the problem of placing a single relay node to maximize the capacity of a broadcast relay channel in a wideband regime. The linear deterministic channel model ([7]) is used in [8] to study the problem of placing two or more relay nodes along a line so as to maximize the end-to-end data rate. Our present paper is in a similar spirit; however, we use the achievable rate formulas for the N -relay channel (with decode and forward relays) to study the problem of placing relays on a line under individual node power constraints as well as with sum power constraints over the source and the relays.
Another major difference of our paper with [6] and [8] is that we also address the problem of sequential placement of

the relay nodes along a line having unknown random length. Such a problem is motivated by the problem faced by “ﬁrstresponders" to emergencies (large building ﬁres, buildings with terrorists and hostages), in which these personnel might need to deploy wireless sensor networks “as-they-go." Howard et al., in [9], provide heuristic algorithms for incremental deployment of sensors (such as surveillance cameras) with the objective of covering the deployment area. Souryal et al., in [10], address the problem of impromptu deployment of static wireless networks with an extensive study of indoor RF link quality variation. More recently, Sinha et al. ([11]) have provided a Markov Decision Process based formulation of a problem to establish a multi-hop network between a sink and an unknown source location by placing relay nodes along a random lattice path. The formulation in [11] is based on the so-called “lone packet trafﬁc model" under which, at any time instant, there can be no more than one packet traversing the network, thereby eliminating contention between wireless links. In our present paper, we consider the problem of asyou-go relay node placement so as to maximize a certain information theoretic capacity limiting term which is derived from the results on the ﬁxed length line segment.

B. Our Contribution

• In Section III, we consider the problem of placing a single

relay with individual power constraints at the source and

the relay. In this context, we provide explicit formulas

for the optimal relay location and the optimal source

power split (between providing new information to the

relay and cooperating with the relay to assist the sink),

for the exponential path-loss model (Theorem 2) and for

the power law path-loss model (Theorem 3). We ﬁnd that

at low attenuation it is better to place the relay near the

source, whereas at very high attenuation the relay should

be placed at half-distance between the source and the

sink.

• In Section IV, we focus on the N relay placement

problem with exponential path-loss model and a sum

power constraint among the source and the relays. For

given relay locations, the optimal power split among the

nodes and the achievable rate are given in Theorem 4

in terms of the channel gains. We explicitly solve the

single relay placement problem in this context (Theo-

rem 5). A numerical study shows that, the relay nodes

are clustered near the source at low attenuation and are

placed uniformly between the source and the sink at

high attenuation. We have also studied the asymptotic

behaviour of the achievable rate RN when N relay nodes

are placed uniformly on a line of ﬁxed length, and show

that for a total power constraint PT among the the source

and

the

relays,

where

C (·)

is the AWGN capacity formula and σ2 is the power of

the additive white Gaussian noise at each node.

• In Section V, we consider the problem of placing relay

nodes along a line of random length. Speciﬁcally, the

problem is to start from a source, and walk along a

line, placing relay nodes as we go, until the line ends,

3

at which point the sink is placed. We are given that the distance between the source and the sink is exponentially distributed. With a sum power constraint over the source and the deployed relays, the aim is to maximize a certain capacity limiting term that is derived from the problem over a ﬁxed length line segment, while constraining the expected number of relays that are used. Since the objective can be expressed as a sum of certain terms over the inter-relay links, we “relax" the expected number of relays constraint via a Lagrange multiplier, and thus formulate the problem as a total cost Markov Decision Process (MDP), with an uncountable state space and non-compact action sets. We establish the existence of an optimal policy, and convergence of value iteration, and also provide some properties of the value function. A numerical study supports certain intuitive structural properties of the optimal policy.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe our system model and notation. In Section III, node placement with per-node power constraint is discussed. Node placement for total power constraint is discussed in Section IV. Sequential placement of relay nodes for sum power constraint is discussed in Section V. Conclusions are drawn in Section VI. The proofs of all the theorems are given in the appendices.
II. THE MULTIRELAY CHANNEL: NOTATION AND REVIEW
A. Network and Propagation Models
The multi-relay channel was studied in [12] and [13] and is an extension of the single relay model presented in [14]. We consider a network deployed on a line with a source node, a sink node at the end of the line, and N full-duplex relay nodes as shown in Figure 1. The relay nodes are numbered as 1, 2, · · · , N . The source and sink are indexed by 0 and N + 1, respectively. The distance of the k-th node from the source is denoted by yk := r1 + r2 + · · · + rk. Thus, yN+1 = L. As in [12] and [13], we consider the scalar, time-invariant, memoryless, additive white Gaussian noise setting. We do not consider propagation delays, hence, we use the model that a symbol transmitted by node i is received at node j after multiplication by the (positive, real valued) channel gain hi,j; such a model has been used by previous researchers, see [12], [15]. The Gaussian additive noise at any receiver is independent and identically distributed from symbol to symbol and has variance σ2. The power gain from Node i to Node j is denoted by gi,j = h2i,j. We model the power gain via two alternative path-loss models: exponential path-loss and powerlaw path-loss. The power gain at a distance r is e−ρr for the exponential path-loss model and r−η for the power-law pathloss model, where ρ > 0, η > 1. These path- loss models have their roots in the physics of wireless channels ([16]). For the exponential path-loss model, we will denote λ := ρL; λ can be treated as a measure of attenuation in the line network. Under the exponential path-loss model, the channel gains and power gains in the line network become multiplicative, e.g., hi,i+2 = hi,i+1hi+1,i+2 and gi,i+2 = gi,i+1gi+1,i+2

for i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N − 1}. In this case, we deﬁne gi,i = 1 and hi,i = 1. The power-law path-loss expression fails to characterize near-ﬁeld transmission, since it goes to ∞ as r → 0. One alternative is the “modiﬁed power-law pathloss” model where the path-loss is min{r−η, b−η} with b > 0 a reference distance. In this paper we consider both powerlaw and modiﬁed power-law path loss models, apart from the exponential path-loss model.

B. An Inner Bound to the Capacity of the Multi-Relay Channel

For the multi-relay channel, we denote the symbol trans-
mitted by the i-th node at time t (t is discrete) by Xi(t) for i = 0, 1, · · · , N . Zk(t) ∼ N (0, σ2) is the additive white Gaussian noise3 at node k and time t, and is assumed to be
independent and identically distributed across k and t. Thus,
at symbol time t, node k, 1 ≤ k ≤ N + 1 receives:

Yk(t) =

hj,kXj (t) + Zk(t)

where Pi,j denotes the power at which node i transmits to node j.

In order to provide insight into the expression in (2) and the relay placement results in this paper, we provide a descriptive overview of the coding and decoding scheme described in [12]. Transmissions take place via block codes of T symbols each. The transmission blocks at the source and the N relays are synchronized. The coding and decoding scheme is such that a message generated at the source at the beginning of block b, b ≥ 1, is decoded by the sink at the end of block b + N , i.e., N + 1 block durations after the message was generated (with probability tending to 1, as T → ∞). Thus, at the end of B blocks, B ≥ N + 1, the sink is able to decode B − N messages. It follows, by taking B → ∞, that, if the code rate is R bits per symbol, then an information rate of R bits per symbol can be achieved from the source to the sink.

As mentioned earlier, we index the source by 0, the relays by k, 1 ≤ k ≤ N , and the sink by N + 1. There are (N + 1)2
independent Gaussian random codebooks, each containing 2T R codes, each code being of length T ; these codebooks are available to all nodes. At the beginning of block b, the source generates a new message wb, and, at this stage, we assume that each node k, 1 ≤ k ≤ N + 1, has a reliable estimate of all the messages wb−j, j ≥ k. In block b, the source uses a new codebook to encode wb. In addition, relay k, 1 ≤ k ≤ N, and all of its previous transmitters (indexed

4

0 ≤ j ≤ k − 1), use another codebook to encode wb−k (or their estimate of it). Thus, if the relays 1, 2, · · · , k have a perfect estimate of wb−k at the beginning of block b, they will transmit the same codeword for wb−k. Therefore, in block b, the source and relays 1, 2, · · · , k coherently transmit the codeword for wb−k. In this manner, in block b, transmitter k, 0 ≤ k ≤ N, generates N + 1 − k codewords, corresponding to wb−k, wb−k−1, · · · , wb−N , which are transmitted with powers Pk,k+1, Pk,k+2, · · · , Pk,N+1. In block b, node k, 1 ≤ k ≤ N +1, receives a superposition of transmissions from all other nodes. Assuming that node k knows all the powers, and all the channel gains, and recalling that it has a reliable estimate of all the messages wb−j, j ≥ k, it can subtract the interference from transmitters k + 1, k + 2, · · · , N . At the end of block b, after subtracting the signals it knows, node k is left with the k received signals from nodes 0, 1, · · · , (k − 1) (received in blocks b, b − 1, · · · , b − k + 1), which all carry an encoding of the message wb−k+1. These k signals are then jointly used to decode wb−k+1, using joint typicality decoding. The codebooks are cycled through in a manner so that in any block all nodes encoding a message (or their estimate of it) use the same codebook, but different (thus, independent) codebooks are used for different messages. Under this encoding and decoding scheme, relatively simple arguments lead to the conclusion that any rate strictly less than R displayed in (2) is achievable.

From the above description we see that a node receives

information about a message in two ways (i) by the message

being directed to it cooperatively by all the previous nodes, and

(ii) by overhearing previous transmissions of the message to

the previous nodes. Thus node k receives codes corresponding

to a message k times before it attempts to decode the message.

Note that, C

j−1 i=0

Pi,j )2

in (2), for any k,

denotes a possible rate that can be achieved by node k from

the transmissions from nodes 0, 1, · · · , k − 1. The smallest of

these terms become the bottleneck, which has been reﬂected

in (2).

For the single relay channel, N = 1. Thus, by (2), an achievable rate is given by (see also [14]):

R = min

C g0,1P0,1 , σ2
g0,2P0,1 + (h0,2 P0,2 + h1,2 P1,2)2 C σ2 (3)

Here, the ﬁrst term in the min{·, ·} of (3) is the achievable rate at node 1 (i.e., the relay node) due to the transmission from the source. The second term in the min{·, ·} corresponds to the possible achievable rate at the sink node due to direct coherent transmission to itself from the source and the relay and due to the overheard transmission from the source to the relay.
The higher the channel attenuation, the less will be the contribution of farther nodes, “overheard" transmissions become less relevant, and coherent transmission reduces to a simple transmission from the previous relay. The system is then closer

to simple store-and-forward relaying.
The authors of [12] have shown that any rate strictly less than R is achievable through the above-mentioned coding and decoding scheme which involves coherent multi-stage relaying and interference subtraction. This achievable rate formula can also be obtained from the capacity formula of a physically degraded multi-relay channel (see [13] for the channel model), since the capacity of the degraded relay channel is a lower bound to the actual channel capacity. In this paper, we will seek to optimize R in (2) over power allocations to the nodes and the node locations, keeping in mind that R is a lower bound to the actual capacity. We denote the value of R optimized over power allocation and relay locations by R∗.
The following result justiﬁes our aim to seek optimal relay placement on the line joining the source and the sink (rather than anywhere else on the plane).
Theorem 1: For given source and sink locations, the relays should always be placed on the line segment joining the source and the sink in order to maximize the end-to-end data rate between the source and the sink.
Proof: See Appendix A.

III. SINGLE RELAY NODE PLACEMENT: NODE POWER CONSTRAINTS

In this section, we aim at placing a single relay node
between the source and the sink in order to maximize the
achievable rate R given by (3). Let the distance between the source and the relay be r, i.e., r1 = r. Let α := PP00,1 . We assume that the source and the relay use the same transmit
power P . Hence, P0,1 = αP , P0,2 = (1 − α)P and P1,2 = P .
Thus, for a given placement of the relay node, we obtain:

R = min

C αg0,1P , σ2

P

C σ2 g0,2 + g1,2 + 2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2

(6)

Maximizing over α and r, and exploiting the monotonicity of C(·) yields the following problem:

max max min αg0,1, g0,2 + g1,2 + 2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2 (7)
r∈[0,L] α∈[0,1]
Note that g0,1 and g1,2 in the above equation depend on r, but g0,2 does not depend on r.

A. Exponential Path Loss Model
1) Optimum Relay Location: Here g0,1 = e−ρr, g1,2 = e−ρ(L−r) and g0,2 = e−ρL. Let λ := ρL, and the optimum relay location be r∗. Let x∗ := rL∗ be the normalized optimal relay location. Let α∗ be the optimum value of α when relay is optimally placed.

(iv) For λ ≥ log 4, x∗ = x+. Moreover, α∗ and R∗ are given

by (4) and (5).

Proof: See Appendix B.
2) Numerical Work: In Figure 2, we plot x∗ and α∗ provided by Theorem 2, versus λ. Recalling the discussion of the coding/decoding scheme in Section II, we note that the relay provides two beneﬁts to the source: (i) being nearer to the source than the sink, the power required to transmit a message to the relay is less than that to the sink, and (ii) having received the message, the relay coherently assists the source in resolving ambiguity at the sink. These two beneﬁts correspond to the two terms in (3). Hence, Theorem 2 and Figure 2 provide the following insights:

• At very low attenuation (λ ≤ log 2), x∗ = 0 (since x+ ≤

0).

Since

g1,2

and

g0,2

we

will

always

have

g0,2 +g1,2 +2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2 ≥ αg0,1 for all α ∈ [0, 1]

and for all r ∈ [0, L]. The minimum of the two terms in

(7) is maximized by α = 1 and r = 0.

Note that the maximum possible achievable rate from

the source to the sink for any value of λ is C

P σ2

,

since the source has a transmit power P . In the low attenuation regime, we can dedicate the entire source power to the relay and place the relay at the source,

so that the relay can receive at a rate C

P σ2

from

the source. The attenuation is so small that even at this position of the relay, the sink can receive data at

a rate C

P σ2

by receiving data from the relay and

overhearing the transmission from the source to the relay;

since α∗ = 1, there is no coherent transmission involved

in this situation.

• For log 2 ≤ λ ≤ log 4, we again have x∗ = 0. α∗ decreases from 1 to 34 as λ increases. In this case since attenuation is higher, the source needs to direct some

power to the sink for transmitting coherently with the

relay to the sink to balance the source to relay data rate.

λ = log 4 is the critical value of λ at which source to

relay channel ceases to be the bottleneck. Hence, for

λ ∈ [log 2, log 4], we still place the relay at the source

but the source reserves some of its power to transmit to

the sink coherently with the relay’s transmission to the

sink. As attenuation increases, the source has to direct

more power to the sink, and so α∗ decreases with λ.

• For λ ≥ log 4, x∗ ≥ 0. Since attenuation is high, the

sink overhears less the source to relay transmissions and

the relay to sink transmissions become more important.

Hence, it is no longer optimal to keep the relay close

to the source. Thus, x∗ increases with λ. Since the link

between the source and the sink becomes less and less

useful as λ increases, we dedicate less and less power

for the direct transmission from the source to the sink.

Hence, α∗ increases with λ. As λ → ∞, x∗ → 21 and α∗ → 1. We observe that the ratio of powers received by

the

sink

from

the

source

and

the

relay

is

less

than

e−

λ 2

,

since x∗ ≤ 21 . This ratio tends to zero as λ → ∞. Thus,

at high attenuation, the source transmits at full power to

the relay and the relay acts just as a repeater.
• We observe that x∗ ≤ 21 . The two data rates in (6) can be equal only if r ≤ L2 . Otherwise we will readily have g0,1 ≤ g0,2 + g1,2, which means that the two rates will

not be equal.

B. Power Law Path Loss Model
1) Optimum Relay Location: For the power-law path-loss model, g0,1 = r−η, g0,2 = L−η and g1,2 = (L − r)−η. Let x∗ be the normalized optimum relay location which maximizes R. Then the following theorem states how to compute x∗.
Theorem 3: (i) For the single relay channel and powerlaw path-loss model (with η > 1), there is a unique optimal placement point for the relay on the line joining the source and the sink, maximizing R. The normalized

(ii) For the “modiﬁed power-law path-loss” model with 2b < L, the normalized optimum relay location is x∗ = max{p, Lb }.
Proof: See Appendix B.

2) Numerical Work: The variation of x∗ and α∗ as a function of η for the power-law path loss model are shown in Figure 3. As η increases, both x∗ and α∗ increase. For large η, they are close to 0.5 and 1 respectively, which means that the relay works just as a repeater. At low attenuation the behaviour is different from exponential path-loss because in that case the two rates in (6) can be equalized since channels gains are unbounded. For small η, relay is placed close to the source, g0,1 is high and hence a small α sufﬁces to equalize the two rates. Thus, we are in a situation similar to the λ ≥ log 4 case for exponential path-loss model. Hence, α∗ and x∗ increase with λ.

On the other hand, the variation of x∗ and α∗ with η under

the modiﬁed power-law path-loss model are shown in Figure 4,

r ∈ [0, b]. For small values of η, p ≤ 0.1 and hence x∗ = 0.1.

Beyond the point where 0.1 is the solution of (x−η+1−1)2(1−
( x1 −1)−η) = (1−x)−η −( x1 −1)−η, the behaviour is similar to the power-law path-loss model. However, for those values of η
which result in p ≤ Lb , the value of α∗ decreases with η. This happens because in this region, if η increases, g0,1 = b−η decreases at a slower rate compared to g1,2 = (L − b)−η (since b < L2 ) and g1,2 decreases at a slower rate compared to g0,2 = L−η, and, hence, more source power should be

dedicated for direct transmission to the sink as η increases. The

variation of α∗ is not similar to that in Figure 2 because here,

unlike the exponential path-loss model, g0,1 remains constant

over the region r ∈ [0, b] and also because η > 1.

IV. MULTIPLE RELAY PLACEMENT : SUM POWER CONSTRAINT

In this section, we consider the optimal placement of relay

nodes to maximize R (see (2)), subject to a total power con-

straint on the source and relay nodes given by

N i=0

Pi

=

PT .

We consider only the exponential path-loss model. We will ﬁrst

maximize R in (2) over Pi,j, 0 ≤ i < j ≤ (N + 1) for any

given placement of nodes (i.e., given y1, y2, · · · , yN ). This will

provide an expression of achievable rate in terms of channel

gains, which has to be maximized over y1, y2, · · · , yN . Let

γk :=

Hence,

the

Proof: The basic idea of the proof is to choose the power levels (i.e., Pi,j, 0 ≤ i < j ≤ N + 1) in (2) so that all the terms in the min{·} in (2) become equal. This has been proved in [13] via an inductive argument based on the coding scheme used in [13], for a degraded Gaussian multi-relay channel. However, we provide explicit expressions for Pi,j, 0 ≤ i < j ≤ N + 1 and the achievable rate (optimized over power allocation) in terms of the power gains, and the proof depends

Remarks and Discussion:

• We ﬁnd that in order to maximize RPopTt(y1, y2, · · · , yN ), we need to place the relay nodes such that g01,1 +

is minimized. This quantity

can be seen as the net attenuation the power PT faces.

• When no relay is placed, the effective attenuation is

eρL. The ratio of the attenuation with no relay and the

attenuation with relays is called the “relaying gain” G,

and is deﬁned as follows:

G := + 1

and eρL.

• From (8), it follows that any node k < j will transmit at a

higher power to node j, compared to any node preceding

node k.

• Note that we have derived Theorem 4 using the fact that

g0,k is nonincreasing in k. If there exists some k ≥ 1 such

that g0,k = g0,k+1, i.e, if k-th and (k + 1)-st nodes are

placed at the same position, then γk+1 = 0, i.e., the nodes

i < k do not direct any power speciﬁcally to relay k + 1.

However, relay k + 1 can decode the symbols received

at relay k, and those transmitted by relay k. Then relay

(k + 1) can transmit coherently with the nodes l ≤ k to

improve effective received power in the nodes j > k + 1.

A. Optimal Placement of a Single Relay Node
Theorem 5: For the single relay node placement problem with sum power constraint and exponential path-loss model, the normalized optimum relay location yL1∗ , power allocation and optimized achievable rate are given as follows :

(i) For λ ≤ log 3, yL1∗ = 0, P0,1 = e2λP+T1 , P0,2 = P1,2 =

eeλλ−+11 P2T and R∗ = C (eλ2+P1T)σ2 .

P0,2 = √e1λ+1 P2T , P1,2 = √eλe+λ+1−1 1 P2T and R∗ =

Proof: See Appendix C. Remarks and Discussion:

• It is easy to check that R∗ obtained in Theorem 5 is

strictly greater than the AWGN capacity C

PT σ2

e−λ

for

all λ > 0. This happens because the source and relay

transmit coherently to the sink. R∗ becomes equal to the

AWGN capacity only at λ = 0. At λ = 0, we do not use

the relay since the sink can decode any message that the

relay is able to decode. • The variation of yL1∗ and PP0T,1 with λ has been shown
in Figure 5. We observe that (from Figure 5 and Theorem 5) limλ→∞ yL1∗ = 12 , limλ→∞ P0,2 = 0 and
limλ→0 P0,1 = PT . For large values of λ, source and

relay cooperation provides negligible beneﬁt since source

to sink attenuation is very high. So it is optimal to place the relay at a distance L2 . The relay works as a repeater which forwards data received from the source to the sink.

B. Optimal Relay Placement for a Multi-Relay Channel

As we discussed earlier, we need to place N relay nodes

such that g01,1 +

(g0,k−1−g0,k )

k=2 g0,k g0,k−1

is minimized. Here

0,l

g0,k = e−ρyk . We have the constraint 0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ · · · ≤

yN ≤ yN+1 = L. Now, writing zk = eρyk , and deﬁning

z0 := 1, we arrive at the following optimization problem:

min

N+1 zk − zk−1

z1 +

k−1

k=2 l=0 zl

s.t 1 ≤ z1 ≤ · · · ≤ zN ≤ zN+1 = eρL (12)

One special feature of the objective function is that it is convex in each of the variables z1, z2, · · · , zN . The objective function is sum of linear fractionals, and the constraints are linear.

Remark: From optimization problem (12) we observe that

optimum z1, z2, · · · , zN depend only on λ := ρL. Since zk =

we

ﬁnd

that

Theorem 6: For ﬁxed ρ, L and σ2, the optimized achievable rate R∗ for a sum power constraint strictly increases with the
number of relay nodes.

Proof: See Appendix C.

Let us denote the relaying gain G in (11) by G(N, λ).

Theorem 7: For any ﬁxed number of relays N ≥ 1, G(N, λ) is increasing in λ.

Proof: See Appendix C.

C. Numerical Work
We discretize the interval [0, L] and run a search program to ﬁnd normalized optimal relay locations for different values of λ and N . The results are summarized in Figure 6. We observe that at low attenuation (small λ), relay nodes are clustered near the source node and are often at the source node, whereas at high attenuation (large λ) they are almost uniformly placed along the line. For large λ, the effect of long distance between any two adjacent nodes dominates the gain obtained by coherent relaying. Hence, it is beneﬁcial to minimize the maximum distance between any two adjacent nodes and thus multihopping is a better strategy in this case. On the other hand, if attenuation is low, the gain obtained by coherent transmission is dominant. In order to allow this, relays should be able to receive sufﬁcient information from their previous nodes. Thus, they tend to be clustered near the source.5
In Figure 7 we plot the relaying gain G(N, λ) in dB vs. the number of relays N , for various values of λ. As proved in Theorem 6, we see that the G(N, λ) increases with N for ﬁxed λ. On the other hand, G(N, λ) increases with λ for ﬁxed N , as proved in Theorem 7.
D. Uniformly Placed Relays, Large N
If the relays are uniformly placed, the behaviour of RPopTt(y1, y2, · · · , yN ) (called RN in the next theorem) for large number of relays is captured by the following Theorem.
Theorem 8: For the exponential path-loss model with total power constraint, if N relay nodes are placed uniformly
5At low attenuation, one or more than one relay nodes are placed very close to the source. We believe that some of them will indeed be placed at the source, but it is not showing up in Figure 6 because we discretized the interval [0, L] to run a search program to ﬁnd optimum relay locations.

V. OPTIMAL SEQUENTIAL PLACEMENT OF RELAY NODES ON A LINE OF RANDOM LENGTH
In this section, we consider the sequential placement of relay nodes along a straight line having unknown random length, subject to a total power constraint on the source node and the relay nodes. For analytical tractability, we model the length of the line as an exponential random variable with mean L = β1 .6 We are motivated by the scenario where, starting from the data source, a person is walking along the line, and places relays at appropriate places in order to maximize the end-to-end achievable data rate (to a sink at the end of the line) subject to a total power constraint and a constraint on the mean number of relays placed. We formulate the problem as a total cost Markov decision process (MDP).

A. Formulation as an MDP

We recall from (10) that for a ﬁxed length L of the

line and a ﬁxed N , eρy1 +

has to N+1

eρyk −eρyk−1

k=2 1+eρy1 +···+eρyk−1

which captures the effect of attenuation and relaying on the

PT σ2

.

In the “as-you-go" placement problem, the person carries

a number of nodes and places them as he walks, under the control of a placement policy. A deployment policy π is a sequence of mappings µk, k ≥ 1, where at the k-th decision instant µk provides the distance at which the next relay should be placed (provided that the line does not end before that

point). The decisions are made based on the locations of the

relays placed earlier. The ﬁrst decision instant is the start of the

line, and the subsequent decision instants are the placement points of the relays. Let Π denote the set of all deployment

6One justiﬁcation for the use of the exponential distribution, given the prior knowledge of the mean length L, is that it is the maximum entropy continuous probability density function with the given mean. Thus, by using the exponential distribution, we are leaving the length of the line as uncertain as we can, given the prior knowledge of its mean.

9

policies. Let Eπ denote the expectation under policy π. Let ξ > 0 be the cost of placing a relay. We are interested in solving the following problem:

inf Eπ
π∈Π

N +1
eρy1 +

eρyk − eρyk−1

+ ξN

1 + eρy1 + · · · + eρyk−1

k=2

(13)

Note that, due to the randomness of the length of the line, the yk, k ≥ 1, are also random variables.

We now formulate the above “as-you-go" relay placement
problem as a total cost Markov decision process. Let us deﬁne s0 := 1, sk := 1+eρy1e+ρy·k··+eρyk ∀ k ≥ 1. Also, recall that rk+1 = yk+1 − yk. Thus, we can rewrite (13) as follows:

N

inf Eπ 1 + sk(eρrk+1 − 1) + ξN

(14)

π∈Π

k=0

When the person starts walking from the source along the line, the state of the system is set to s0 := 1. At this instant the placement policy provides the location at which the ﬁrst relay should be placed. The person walks towards the prescribed placement point. If the line ends before reaching this point, the sink is placed; if not, then the ﬁrst relay is placed at the placement point. In general, the state after placing the k-th relay is denoted by sk, for k = 1, 2, · · · . At state sk, the action is the distance rk+1 where the next relay has to be placed. If the line ends before this distance, the sink node has to be placed at the end. The randomness is coming from the random residual length of the line. Let lk denote the residual length of the line at the k-th instant.
With this notation, the state of the system evolves as follows:

sk+1 =

1+sksekρerρkr+k+ 1 1 , if lk > rk+1, e, else.

(15)

Here e denotes the end of the line, i.e., the termination state. The single stage cost incurred when the state is s, the action is a and the residual length of the line is l, is given by:

ξ + s(eρa − 1), if l > a,

c(s, a, l) = s(eρl − 1), if l ≤ a.

(16)

Also, c(e, a, ·) = 0 for all a.
Now, from (15), it is clear that the next state sk+1 depends on the current state sk, the current action rk+1 and the residual length of the line. Since the line is exponentially distributed the residual length need not be retained in the state description; from any placement point, the residual line length is exponentially distributed, and independent of the history of the process. Also, the cost incurred at the k-th decision instant is given by (16), which depends on sk, rk+1 and lk. Hence, our problem (13) is an MDP problem with state space S := (0, 1] ∪ {e} and action space A ∪ {∞} where A := [0, ∞). Action ∞ means that no further relay will be placed.

Solving the problem in (13) also helps in solving the following constrained problem:

inf Eπ
π∈Π

N +1
eρy1 +

eρyk − eρyk−1

1 + eρy1 + · · · + eρyk−1

k=2

s.t., Eπ(N ) ≤ M

(17)

where M > 0 is the constraint on the average number of relays. The following standard result tells us how to choose the optimal ξ:
Lemma 1: Let πξ∗ ∈ Π be an optimal policy for the unconstrained problem (13) such that Eπξ∗ N = M . Then πξ∗ is also optimal for the constrained problem (17).

The constraint on the mean number of relays can be justiﬁed if we consider the relay deployment problem for multiple sourcesink pairs over several different lines of mean length L, given a large pool of relays, and we are only interested in keeping small the total number of relays over all these deployments.

Remark: The optimal policy for the problem (13) will be
used to place relay nodes along a line whose length is a sample from an exponential distribution with mean β1 . After the deployment is over, the power PT will be shared optimally among the source and the deployed relay nodes (according to
the formulas in Theorem 4), in order to implement the coding
scheme (as described in Section II-B) in the network.

B. Analysis of the MDP

Suppose sk = s for some k ≥ 0. Then, the optimal value function (cost-to-go) at state s is deﬁned by:

Jξ(s) = inf E
π∈Π

∞
c(sn, an, ln)|sk = s
n=k

If we decide to place the next relay at a distance a < ∞ and follow the optimal policy thereafter, the expected cost-to-go at a state s ∈ (0, 1] becomes:

a

βe−βzs(eρz − 1)dz

0

−βa

ρa

+ e s(e − 1) + ξ + Jξ 1 + seρa

(18)

The ﬁrst term in (18) corresponds to the case in which the line ends at a distance less than a and we are forced to place the sink node. The second term corresponds to the case where the residual length of the line is greater than a and a relay is placed at a distance a.

Note that our MDP has an uncountable state space S = (0, 1]∪{e} and a non-compact action space A = [0, ∞)∪{∞}. Several technical issues arise in this kind of problems, such as the existence of optimal or -optimal policies, measurability of the policies, etc. We, therefore, invoke the results provided by Schäl [17], which deal with such issues. Our problem is one of minimizing total, undiscounted, non-negative costs over an inﬁnite horizon. Equivalently, in the context of [17], we have a problem of total reward maximization where the rewards are the negative of the costs. Thus, our problem speciﬁcally ﬁts

10

into the negative dynamic programming setting of [17] (i.e., Thus, the value function of this policy is upper bounded by:

the N case where single-stage rewards are non-positive).
Now, we observe that the state e is absorbing. Also no action is taken at this state and the cost at this state is 0. Hence, we can think of this state as state 0 in order to make our state space a Borel subset of the real line. We present the following theorem from [17] in our present context.
Theorem 9: [[17], Equation (3.6)] The optimal value function Jξ(·) satisﬁes the Bellman equation.

Proof: We know that Jξ(s) ≤ θs ≤ θ. Now, let

Recall that the line has a length having exponential distribution with mean β1 and that the path-loss exponent is ρ for the exponential path-loss model. We analyze the MDP problem for the two different cases: β > ρ and β ≤ ρ.
1) Case I (β > ρ): We observe that the cost of not placing any relay (i.e., a = ∞) at state s ∈ (0, 1] is given by:
∞
βe−βzs(eρz − 1)dz = θs
0
where θ := β−ρ ρ (using the fact that β > ρ). Since not placing a relay (i.e., a = ∞) is a possible action for every s, it follows that Jξ(s) ≤ θs.
The cost in (18), upon simpliﬁcation, can be written as:

us consider the Bellman equation (21). It is easy to see that − θseρa + ξ + Jξ 1+sesρeaρa is strictly negative for sufﬁciently large a. Hence, for a given s, the R.H.S of (21) is strictly less than θs.

Corollary 1: For β > ρ, Jξ(s) → 0 as s → 0 for any ξ > 0.

2) Case II (β ≤ ρ): Here the cost in (18) is ∞ if we do not place a relay (i.e., if a = ∞). Let us consider a policy π1 where we place the next relay at a ﬁxed distance 0 < a < ∞ from the current relay, irrespective of the current state. If the

same transition structure, but with the horizon length being k (instead of inﬁnite horizon as in our original problem) and 0 terminal cost. Here, by horizon length k, we mean that there are k number of relays available for deployment.

residual length of the line is z at any state s, we will place less than az additional relays, and for each relay a cost less than (ξ + (eρa − 1)) is incurred (since s ≤ 1). At the last step when we place the sink, a cost less than (eρa − 1) is incurred.

Let Γk(s) be the set of minimizers of (24) at the k-th iteration at state s, if the inﬁmum is achieved at some a < ∞.
Let Γ∞(s) := {a ∈ A : a be an accumulation point of some sequence {ak} where each ak ∈ Γk(s)}. Let Γ∗(s) be the set

11

of minimizers in (23). In Appendix D, we show that Γk(s) for each k ≥ 1, Γ∞(s) and Γ∗(s) are nonempty.
Theorem 10: The value iteration given by (24) has the following properties:
(i) Jξ(k)(s) → Jξ(s) for all s ∈ (0, 1], i.e., the value iteration converges to the optimal value function.
(ii) Γ∞(s) ⊂ Γ∗(s). (iii) There is a stationary optimal policy f ∞ where f :
(0, 1] → A and f (s) ∈ Γ∞(s) for all s ∈ (0, 1].
Proof: The proof is given in Appendix D, Section B. It uses some advanced mathematical tools, which have been discussed in Appendix D, Section A.

E. Properties of the Value Function Jξ(s)
Proposition 3: Jξ(s) is increasing and concave over s ∈ (0, 1].
Proposition 4: Jξ(s) is increasing and concave in ξ for all s ∈ (0, 1].
Proposition 5: Jξ(s) is continuous in s over (0, 1] and continuous in ξ over (0, ∞).
Proofs of the Propositions 3-5 have been given in Appendix D, Section C. The proofs show that the increasing, concave nature of the value function is preserved at every stage of the value iteration (24), and use the fact that Jξ(k)(s) → Jξ(s).

Note that, Λ plays the same role as λ played in the known L case (see Section IV). Since β1 is the mean length of the line, Λ can be considered as a measure of attenuation in the
network. We can think of the new problem (25) in the same
way as (13), but with the length of the line being exponentially
distributed with mean 1 (β = 1) and the path-loss exponent being changed to ρ = Λ = βρ . The relay locations are also normalized (z˜k = βyk). One can solve the new problem (25)
and obtain the optimal policy. Then the solution to (13) can
be obtained by multiplying each control distance (from the optimal policy of (25)) with the constant β1 . Hence, it sufﬁces to work with β = 1.

G. A Numerical Study of the Optimal Policy

Let us recall that the state of the system after placing the k-th relay is given by sk = keΛz˜k . The action is the
i=0 eΛz˜i
normalized distance of the next relay to be placed from the current location. The single stage cost function for our total cost minimization problem is given by (16).
In our numerical work, we discretized the state space (0, 1] into 100 steps, so that the state space becomes {0.01, 0.02, · · · , 0.99, 1}. We discretized the action space into steps of size 0.001, i.e., the action space becomes {0, 0.001, 0.002, · · · }.
We performed numerical experiments to study the structure of the optimal policy obtained through value iteration for β = 1 and some values of Λ := βρ . The value iteration in this experiment converged and we obtained a unique stationary optimal policy, though Theorem 10 does not guarantee the uniqueness of the stationary optimal policy. Figure 8 shows that the normalized optimal placement distance a∗ is decreasing with the state s ∈ (0, 1]. This can be understood as follows. The state s (at a placement point) is small only if a sufﬁciently large number of relays have already been placed.7 Hence, if several relays have already been placed and ki=0 eΛz˜i is sufﬁciently large compared to eΛz˜k (i.e., sk is small), the (k + 1)-st relay will be able to receive sufﬁcient amount of power from the previous nodes, and hence does not need to be placed close to the k-th relay. A value of sk close to 1 indicates that there is a large gap between relay k and relay k − 1, the power received at the next relay from the previous

relays is small and hence the next relay must be placed closer to the last one.
On the other hand, a∗ is increasing with ξ (see also Figure 9, previous page). Recall that ξ can be viewed as the price of placing a relay. This ﬁgure conﬁrms the intuition that if the relay price is high, then the relays should be placed less frequently.
Figure 10 shows that a∗ is decreasing with Λ, for ﬁxed values of ξ and s. This is intuitive since increased attenuation

in the network will require the relays to be placed closer to each other.
Tables I, III and V illustrate the impromptu placement of relay nodes using our policy, for different values of Λ. In this numerical example we applied the policy for β = 1 and three different values of ξ, to a line of length 10. Thus, the policy that we use corresponds to a line having exponentially distributed length with mean 1. If the line actually ends at some point before 10, the process would end there with the corresponding number of relays (as can be obtained from tables I, III and V ) before the end-point having been placed.
We observe that as Λ increases, more relays need to be placed since the optimal control decreases with Λ for each s (see Figure 10). On the other hand, the number of relays decreases with ξ; this can be explained from Figure 9. Note that, initially one or more relays are placed at or near the source if a∗(s = 1) is 0 or small. But, after some relays have been placed, the relays are placed equally spaced apart. We see that this happens because, after a few relays have been placed, the state, s, does not change, hence, resulting in the relays being subsequently placed equally spaced apart. This phenomenon is evident in Tables II, IV and VI. In our present numerical example, the state s will remain unchanged after a relay placement if s = 0.01(s1e+Λas∗eΛ(sa)∗(s)) × 0.01, since we have discretized the state space. After some relays are placed, the state becomes equal to one ﬁxed point s of the function
0.01(s1e+Λas∗eΛ(sa)∗(s)) ×0.01. Note that the deployment starts from

Table VII: Comparison of the performance (in terms of H; see text) of optimal sequential placement over a line of random length, with the optimal placement if the length was known.

s0 := 1, but for any value of s0 (even with s0 smaller than s ), we numerically observe the same phenomenon. Hence, s is an absorbing state.

The numerical experiments reported in Table VII are a result

of asking the following question: how does the cost of an

impromptu deployment over a line of exponentially distributed

length compare with the cost of placing the same number of

relays optimally over the line, once the length of the line

has been revealed? For several combinations of Λ and ξ,

we generated 10000 random numbers independently from an

exponential distribution with parameter β = 1. Each of these

numbers was considered as a possible realization of the length

of the line. Then we computed the placement of the relay

nodes for each realization by optimal sequential placement

policy, which gave us H = g01,1 +

, N +1

(g0,k−1−g0,k )

k=2 g0,k g0,k−1

k−1 1 l=0 g0,l

a quantity that we use to evaluate the quality of the relay

placement. The signiﬁcance of H can be recalled from (10) where we found that the capacity C(1 + PTH/σ2 ) can be achieved if total power PT is available to distribute among

the source and the relays; i.e., H can be interpreted as the net

effective attenuation after power has been allocated optimally

over the nodes. Also, for each realization, we computed H for

one-shot optimal relay placement, assuming that the length

of the line is known and the number of relays available is

the same as the number of relays used by the corresponding

sequential placement policy. For a given combination of Λ

and ξ, for the k-th realization of the length of the line, let us denote the two H values by Hs(ekq)uential and Ho(pkt)imal. Then the
percentage error for the k-th realization is given by:

|H(k) − H(k) |

ek := optimal

sequential × 100

Ho(pkt)imal

The average percentage error in Table VII is the quantity 11k00=0010000ek . The maximum percentage error is the quantity
maxk∈{1,2,··· ,10000} ek. The following is a discussion of the
numerical values in Table VII:

(i) We observe that, for small enough ξ, some relays will be placed at the source itself. For example, for Λ = 0.01 and ξ = 0.001, we will place two relays at the source

itself (See Table I. After placing the ﬁrst relay, the next state will become s = 0.5, and a∗(s = 0.5) = 0). The state after placing the second relay becomes s = 0.34, for which a∗(s = 0.34) = 8.41 (see the placement in Table I). Now, the line having an exponentially distributed length with mean 1 will end before a∗(s = 0.34) = 8.41 distance with high probability, and the probability of placing the third relay will be very small. As a result, the mean number of relays will be 2.0002. In case only 2 relays are placed by the sequential deployment policy and we seek to place 2 relays optimally for the same length of the line (with the length known), the optimal locations for both relays are close to the source location if the length of the line is small (i.e., if the attenuation λ is small, recall the deﬁnition of λ from Section II-A). If the line is long (which has a very small probability), the optimal placement will be signiﬁcantly different from the sequential placement. Altogether, the error will be small in this case. (ii) For Λ = 0.01 and ξ = 0.01, a∗(s = 1) is so large that with probability close to 1 the line will end in a distance less than a∗(s = 1) and no relay will be placed. In this case the optimal placement and the sequential placement match exactly, and the error is 0. (iii) On an average, the error is large for higher attenuation. At low attenuation, with high probability the number of deployed relays is small, and they will be placed at or near the source, in which case the optimal placement is close to the sequential placement. On the other hand, for high attenuation sequential placement uses a considerable number of relays, and the optimal placement may differ signiﬁcantly from sequential placement. Also, we observe (see the last two rows of Table VII) that even for high attenuation, if ξ is too large, then we will not place any relay, which will result in 0 error.
VI. CONCLUSION
We have studied the problem of placing relay nodes along a line, in order to connect a sink at the end of the line to a source at the start of the line, in order to maximize the endto-end achievable data rate. We obtained explicit formulas for the optimal location of a single relay node with individual power constraints on the source and the relay under power-law and exponential path-loss models. For the multi-relay channel with exponential path-loss and sum power constraint, we derived an expression for the achievable rate and formulated the optimization problem to maximize the end-to-end data rate. We solved explicitly the single relay placement problem with exponential path-loss and sum power constraint. The asymptotic performance of uniform relay placement was also studied for the sum power constraint. Finally, a sequential relay placement problem along a line having unknown random length was formulated as an MDP whose value function was characterized analytically and the policy structure was investigated numerically.
Our results in this paper are based on information theoretic capacity results, which make several assumptions: (i) all

14

the nodes should have global knowledge of the codebooks, channel gains, and transmit powers, (ii) relay nodes need to be full-duplex, (iii) global synchronization at block level is required. In our ongoing work, we are also exploring noninformation theoretic, packet forwarding models for optimal relay placement, with the aim of obtaining placement algorithms that can be more easily reduced to practice.
APPENDIX A SYSTEM MODEL AND NOTATION
A. Proof of Theorem 1
Let the source and the sink be located at (0, 0) and (L, 0). There are N number of relays 1, 2, ..., N , where the i-th relay is placed at (ai, bi). Now let us consider a new placement of the relays where for each i ∈ {1, 2, ..., N }, the i-th relay is placed at (ai, 0). Let us deﬁne a0 := 0 for the source and aN+1 := L for the sink. This new placement results in a reduced (not necessarily strictly) distance between any two nodes in the multi-relay channel since now there is no variation along y-direction. Let us also assume that the relays are enumerated in the increasing order of their x-coordinate values. Now let A := {i : 1 ≤ i ≤ N, ai > L}, B := {i : 1 ≤ i ≤ N, ai < 0} and C := {i : 1 ≤ i ≤ N, ai ∈ [0, L]}. Let a := mini,j∈{0,1,2,...,N,N+1},i=j |ai−aj |. Clearly, a ≤ L since source and sink are placed L distance apart from each other. If A is nonempty, place all relays belonging to A uniformly (i.e.,with equal distance between two successive nodes) in the interval L − a2 , L . Similarly, if B is nonempty, place all relay nodes belonging to B uniformly in the interval 0, a2 . Thus we obtain a new set of relay locations where each relay is placed on the line segment joining the source and the sink, and the distance between any two relay nodes has been reduced. From (2), it is clear that R increases in the channel gain between each pair of nodes, for any given power allocation scheme. Hence, the optimum relay locations will be such that no relay will be placed outside the line segment joining the source and the sink.
APPENDIX B SINGLE RELAY NODE PLACEMENT: NODE POWER
CONSTRAINTS
A. Proof of Theorem 2
Observe that in (7) g0,2 + g1,2 + 2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2 is decreasing in α and αg0,1 is increasing in α. Also, g0,2 + g1,2 + 2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2|α=1 = g0,2 + g1,2, which is greater than or equal to αg0,1|α=1 if g0,1 ≤ g0,2 +g1,2. This motivates us to consider two different cases: g0,1 ≤ g0,2 + g1,2 and g0,1 ≥ g0,2 + g1,2. We ﬁnd that since g0,1 is decreasing in r and g1,2 is increasing in r, g0,1 ≤ g0,2 + g1√,2 occurs if and only if r ≥ rth, where rth := − ρ1 log e−ρL+ e−22ρL+4e−ρL .
Case I: g0,1 ≤ g0,2 + g1,2. In this case α = 1 is the maximizer of min{g0,2 + g1,2 + 2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2, αg0,1}. So the optimum R in this case becomes C g0σ,12P . Further,

since g0,1 is decreasing in r, in the r ≥ rth region optimum relay location is max{rth, 0}.

Case II: g0,1 ≥ g0,2 + g1,2. This holds for r ≤ rth. Now as α increases from 0 to 1, αg0,1 increases from 0 to g0,1 and (g0,√2 + g1,2 + 2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2) decreases from (g0,2 + g1,2 + 2 g0,2g1,2) to (g0,2 + g1,2). Moreover, both αg0,1 and
(g0,2 + g1,2 + 2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2) are continuous functions of α. Hence, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists αth ∈ [0, 1] such that g0,2 +g1,2 +2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2 = αg0,1 at α = αth. Moreover, min{g0,2 + g1,2 + 2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2, αg0,1} is maximized at α = αth ∈ [0, 1].

From the condition g0,2 +g1,2 +2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2 = αg0,1 we obtain

1

g1,2

g0,2 2

αth = g0,1 g0,2 1 − g0,1 + g1,2 1 − g0,1 (26)

So for r ≤ rth we have

max min g0,2+g1,2+2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2, αg0,1 = αthg0,1
α∈[0,1]

Thus our optimization problem becomes

max
r∈[0,rth ]

g0,2 1 − g1,2 + g0,1

g1,2 1 − g0,2 g0,1

(27)

Let k := e−ρL and u := e−ρr. Deﬁne uth = e−ρrth . Since u strictly decreases with r, our problem becomes

where

max f (u)
u∈[uth ,1]

k

k

k

f (u) = k 1 − u2 + u 1 − u

(28)

Clearly, f (u) is differentiable w.r.t u over [uth, 1]. f (u) =

√2k2/u3 + −√k/u2+2k2/u3 . Hence, f (·) is increasing in u

2 k−k2/u2

2 k/u−k2/u2

over [uth, 1] if and only if its derivative is nonnegative. Setting

f (u) to be nonnegative yields the inequality:

1/u − k/u2

u

1 − k/u2 ≥ −1 + 2k

(29)

Now let us consider the case −1 + 2uk ≤ 0, i.e u ≤ 2k. In this case f (·) is increasing in u. So for r ≥ r0, where r0 = − ρ1 log(u0) = − ρ1 log(2k), f (·) is decreasing in r. Of course this condition matters only if r0 ≤ rth, since, for r ≥ rth, R
always decreases with r. Thus if r0 ≤ rth, then R decreases
with r for r ∈ [r0, rth].

Now for u ≥ 2k, i.e, r ≤ r0, from (29) we will have f (u) ≥ 0 if and only if

u2 u

1

4k2 − k + (1 − 4k ) ≤ 0

So f (·) is increasing in u (decreasing in r) if and only if u ∈ [u−, u+] where u− and u+ are the two roots of the

15

equal√ity version of th√e above inequality and are given by u− = 2k − k, u+ = 2k + k. Now let us deﬁne r+ = − ρ1 log(u+).
√√ u− ≤ uth holds if and only if 3 k − k + 4 ≤ 2. It is easy

to check that this always holds since k ∈ [0, 1] in our case.

But we are maximizing f (·) in the [uth, 1] interval. So f (·) is

increasing in u (decreasing in r) if and only if u ∈ [uth, u+].

√

√

Again, u+ ≥ uth holds if and only if k + 4 − 3 k ≤ 2,

which holds for any k ∈ [0, 1]. So u+ ≥ uth. Hence, r+ ≤ rth.

Thus f (·) decreases with r for r ∈ [r+, rth]. √
Also u+ = 2k + k ≥ 2k = u0. Hence, r+ ≤ r0.

Thus f (·) increases with r for r ∈ [0, r+] and decreases for r ≥ r+. If r+ ≤ 0, f (·) decreases with r in [0, L].

Summary:

1) We found that R is increasing in r for r ≤ r+ and decreasing for r ≥ r+. Let r∗ be the optimal position of the relay node, x∗ := rL∗ and x+ := rL+ = − ρ1L log(u+).
Then x∗ = max{x+, 0}, where x+ = − λ1 log 2e−λ +

3) For λ ≤ log 2, we have r+ ≤ 0 and rth ≤ 0. So in this

case we will place the relay at r∗ = 0 ≥ rth and hence

α∗

=

1

and

R∗

=

C

(

P σ2

).

4) For log 2 ≤ λ ≤ log 4, r+ ≤ 0 and rth ≥ 0. So

r∗ = 0 and hence we place the node at r∗ = 0 ≤ rth.

So α∗ = αth|r=0 = 4e−λ(1 − e−λ) and hence R∗ =

C

P σ2

4e−λ(1

−

e−λ)

.

5) For λ ≥ log 4, r∗ = r+ ≥ 0. So substituting the values

of r+ in (26), we obtain the expression of α∗ (given in

(4)) and thus of R∗ too (given in (5)).

Remark 1: Let xth

=

rLth . Then limλ→∞ xth

=

1 2

and

limλ→∞ x+ = 12 .

Remark 2: αth increases with r in the region r ∈ [0, rth].

Proof: In the region r ≤ rth, for any ﬁxed r,

maxα∈[0,1] min g0,2 + g1,2 + 2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2, αg0,1 is

maximized when g0,2 +g1,2 +2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2 = αg0,1. Let q(α, r) = g0,2 + g1,2 + 2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2 − αg0,1. Clearly, q(α, r) is strictly decreasing in α and strictly increasing in r, and also continuous in both arguments. Also in the region r ≤ rth, q(αth(r), r) = 0. Let us assume that the operating point is {r, αth(r)} for some r < rth. Now consider some r such that r ≤ rth, r > r. Then q(r , αth(r)) > 0. So we must increase α from αth(r) in order to bring q(α, r) back to 0. Hence, αth(r ) > αth(r).

B. Proof of Theorem 3

As we observed in the exponential pathloss model (see proof of Theorem 2),
min g0,2 + g1,2 + 2 (1 − α)g0,2g1,2, αg0,1 is maximized for α = 1 if g0,1 ≤ g0,2 + g1,2. This occurs, assuming the power law path-loss model, if

r−η ≤ L−η + (L − r)−η

(30)

i.e, if r ≥ rth. Note that rth < L2 .
In the region r ≥ rth, g0,1 decreases with r, and hence the optimum placement point in the interval [rth, L] is rth.

In the region r ≤ rth, the problem is similar to the one of case II in the proof of Theorem 2. Thus we arrive at the following problem:

max f (x)
x∈(0,xth ]

where

x :=

Lx ,

xth :=

rth L

and

f (x) = 1 − (1 − x)−η + (1 − x)−η(1 − 1 ) (31)

x−η

x−η

Now f (x) ≥ 0 if and only if:

x−η+1 − 1 ≥ (1 − x)−η − ( x1 − 1)−η (32) 1 − ( x1 − 1)−η

Since x < 12 , η > 1 and the square roots are well-deﬁned,

the condition above can be written as f1(x) ≥ f2(x) where

f1(x)

=

(x−η+1 −1)2(1−(

1 x

− 1)−η )

and

f2(x)

=

(1−x)−η

−

( x1 − 1)−η. Now it is easy to check that f1(x) decreases from

+∞ to 0 as x increases from 0 to 21 . f2(x) increases from 0

to (2η − 1) as x increases from 0 to 21 . So there is a unique

p ∈ [0, 12 ], such that f (x) is increasing in x for x ∈ [0, p] and

decreasing for x ≥ p.

Let us now compare p and xth. Recall that xth ≤ 12 , and

observe

from

(30)

that

xth

veriﬁes:

x−thη

=

1

+

(1

−

x

−η th

),

i.e.,

( x1th )−η + ( x1th − 1)−η = 1. Hence, we have:

(x−η+1 − 1)2

f1(xth) =

th −η

xth

(x−η − 1)2

f2(xth) =

th −η

(33)

xth

Clearly, since xth < 1 and η > 1 we will always have f1(xth) < f2(xth). Thus we must have p < xth. This implies that R increases with r in [0, pL], and decreases with r in
[pL, L]. So R is maximized by placing the relay node at r∗ = pL, where p is obtained by solving f1(x) = f2(x).

For the “modiﬁed power law path-loss” model, if 2b < L,
then g0,1 is constant for r ∈ [0, b] but g1,2 increases with r for r ∈ [0, b]. So if pL < b, we can improve R by placing the relay at b. Hence, x∗ = max{p, Lb } in this case.

APPENDIX C MULTIPLE RELAY PLACEMENT : SUM POWER
CONSTRAINT

A. Proof of Theorem 4

We want to maximize R given in (2) subject to the total power constraint, assuming ﬁxed relay locations. Let us

consider C

1 σ2

kj=1(

j−1 i=0

hi,k

Pi,j)2 , i.e., the k-th term

in the argument of min{· · · } in (2). By the monotonicity

of C(·), it is sufﬁcient to consider

kj=1(

j−1 i=0

hi,k

Pi,j )2.

Now since the channel gains are multiplicative, we have:

k j−1
( hi,k
j=1 i=0

k
Pi,j )2 = g0,k
j=1

j−1 Pi,j 2 i=0 h0,i

Thus our optimization problem becomes:

k

max

min

g0,k

k∈{1,2,··· ,N +1}

j=1

j−1 Pi,j 2 i=0 h0,i

N +1

s.t

γj ≤ PT

j=1

j−1

and

Pi,j = γj ∀ j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1}

(34)

i=0

Let us ﬁx γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1 such that their sum is equal to

PT . We observe that Pi,N+1 for i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N } appear in

the

objective

f√unction

only
2

once:

for

k

=

N

+

1

through

the

term

N i=0

Pi,N +1 h

. Since we have ﬁxed γN+1, we need

0,i

to maximize this term over Pi,N+1, i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N }. So we have the following optimization problem:

N
max
i=0

Pi,N +1 h0,i

N

s.t

Pi,N+1 = γN+1

i=0

(35)

By Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, the objective function
in this optimization problem is upper bounded by
( Ni=0 Pi,N+1)( Ni=0 g01,i ) = γN+1 Ni=0 g01,i (using the fact that g0,i = h20,i ∀i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N }). The upper b√ound is achieved if there exists some c > 0 such that
Pi1,N+1 = c ∀i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N }. So we have
h0,i

c2 Pi,N+1 = g0,i ∀i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N }

Using the fact that

γN +1

N

1

. Thus,

l=0 g0,l

N i=0

Pi,N

+1

=

γN +1 ,

we

obtain

c2

=

Pi,N+1 =

1
Ng0,i 1 γN +1
l=0 g0,l

(36)

Here we have used the fact that h0,0 = 1. Now {Pi,N√: i = 0, 1, · · · , (N −1)} appear only through the sum Ni=−01 hP0i,i,N ,

and it appears twice: for k = N and k = N + 1. We need to

maximize this sum subject to the constraint

N −1 i=0

Pi,N

=

γN . This optimization can be solved in a similar way as

before. Thus by repeatedly using this argument and solving

optimization problems similar in nature to (35), we obtain:

Pi,j =

1
j−g01,i 1 γj ∀0 ≤ i < j ≤ (N + 1)
l=0 g0,l

(37)

Substituting for Pi,j, 0 ≤ i < j ≤ (N + 1) in (34), we obtain the following optimization problem:

k
max min g0,k
k∈{1,2,··· ,N +1} j=1

j−1 1 γj g0,i
i=0

N +1

s.t.

γj ≤ PT

j=1

(38)

Let us deﬁne bk := g0,k and aj := ji=−01 g01,i . Observe that bk is decreasing and ak is increasing with k. Let us deﬁne:

k

s˜k(γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1) := bk aj γj

(39)

j=1

With this notation, our optimization problem becomes:

max min s˜k(γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1)
k∈{1,2,··· ,N +1}

N +1

s.t.

γj ≤ PT

(40)

j=1

Claim 1: Under optimal allocation of γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1 for the optimization problem (40), s˜1 = s˜2 = · · · = s˜N+1.

Proof: The optimization problem (40) can be rewritten as:

max ζ

k

s.t ζ ≤ bk ajγj ∀ k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1},

j=1

N +1

γj ≤ PT ,

j=1

γj ≥ 0 ∀ j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1}

(41)

The dual of this linear program is given by:

min PT θ

N +1

s.t

µk = 1,

k=1 N +1
al bkµk + νl = θ ∀ l ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1},

k=l
θ ≥ 0,

µl ≥ 0, νl ≥ 0 ∀ l ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1}

(42)

Now let us consider a primal feasible solution

17

({γj∗}1≤j≤N+1, ζ∗) which satisﬁes:

k
bk ajγj∗ = ζ∗ ∀ k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1},
j=1

N +1
γj∗ = PT
j=1

(43)

Thus we have, b1a1γ1∗ = ζ∗, i.e., γ1∗ =

ζ∗ ba

. Again, b2(a1γ1∗ +

a2γ2∗) = ζ∗, which implies:

11

b2 ζ∗ + b2a2γ∗ = ζ∗

b1

2

Thus we obtain γ2∗ = ζa∗ ( b1 − b1 ). In general, we can write:

22

1

∗ ζ∗ γk = ak

11 −
bk bk−1

∀k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1}

with b10 obtain:
ζ∗
γj∗

:= 0.
= =

Now from the condition

N +1 k=1

γk∗

=

PT ,

we

PT Nk=+11 a1k ( b1k − bk1−1 )

a1j b1j − bj1−1

PT , j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1}

Nk=+11 a1k ( b1k − bk1−1 )

(44)

It should be noted that since bk is nonincreasing in k, the primal variables above are nonnegative and satisﬁes feasibility conditions. Again, let us consider a dual feasible solution ({µ∗j , νj∗}1≤j≤N+1, θ∗) which satisﬁes:
νl∗ = 0 ∀ l ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1}
N +1
µ∗k = 1
k=1 N +1
al bkµ∗k + νl∗ = θ∗ ∀ l ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1} (45)
k=l

Solving these equations, we obtain:

θ∗ = µ∗j =

1

N +1 1 k=1 bk
b1j ( a1j

a1k − ak1+1 − aj1+1 )

N +1 1 k=1 bk

a1k − ak1+1

, j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1} (46)

where a 1 := 0. Since ak is increasing in k, all dual

N +2
variables are

feasible.

It

is

easy

to

check

that

ζ∗

=

PT θ∗,

which means that there is no duality gap for the chosen primal

and dual variables. Since the primal is a linear program, the

solution

(γ

∗ 1

,

γ2∗

,

·

·

·

, γN∗ +1, ζ∗)

is

primal

optimal.

Thus

we

have established the claim, since the primal optimal solution

satisﬁes it.

So let us obtain γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1 for which s˜1 = s˜2 = · · · = s˜N+1. Putting s˜k = s˜k−1, we obtain :

k

k−1

bk aj γj = bk−1 aj γj

j=1

j=1

(47)

Thus we obtain:

(bk−1 − bk) 1 k−1 γk = bk ak aj γj (48)
j=1

Let dk := (bk−b1k−bk) a1k . Hence,

k−1

γk = dk aj γj

(49)

j=1

From this recursive equation we have:

γ2 = d2a1γ1

(50)

γ3 = d3(a1γ1 + a2γ2) = d3a1(1 + a2d2)γ1 (51)

and in general for k ≥ 3,

γk = dka1Πkj=−21(1 + aj dj )γ1

(52)

Using the fact that γ1 + γ2 + · · · + γN+1 = PT , we obtain:

PT

γ1 =

N +1

k−1

(53)

1 + d2a1 + k=3 dka1Πj=2 (1 + aj dj )

Thus if s˜1 = s˜2 = · · · = s˜N+1, there is a unique allocation γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1. So this must be the one maximizing R. Hence, optimum γ1 is obtained by (53). Then, substituting the values of {ak : k = 0, 1, · · · , N } and dk : k = 1, 2, · · · , N +1 in (52) and (53), we obtain the values of γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1 as shown in Theorem 4.
Now under these optimal values of γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1, all terms in the argument of min{· · · } in (2) are equal. So
we can consider the ﬁrst term alone. Thus we obtain the expression for R optimized over power allocation among all the nodes for ﬁxed relay locations as : RPopTt(y1, y2, · · · , yN ) = C g0,1σP20,1 = C g0σ,12γ1 . Substituting the expression for γ1 from (9), we obtain the achievable rate formula (10).

B. Proof of Theorem 5

Here we want to place the relay node at a distance r1 from the source to minimize g01,1 + g0g,02,(11−+gg00,,21) (see 10). Hence, our optimization problem becomes :

min
r1 ∈[0,L]

eρr1 + e−ρr1 − e−ρL e−ρL(1 + e−ρr1 )

Writing z1 = eρr1 , the problem becomes :

min
z1 ∈[1,eρL ]

eρL + 1 z1 − 1 + z1 + 1

This is a convex optimization problem. Equating the derivative of the objective function to zero, we obtain 1 −

eρL +1
√(z1 +1)2

=

0. Thus the derivative becomes zero at z1

=

1 + eρL − 1 > 0. Hence, the objective function is de-

creasing in z1 for z1 ≤ z1 and increasing in z1 ≥ z1.

So the minimizer is z1∗ = max{z1, 1}. So the optimum

distance

of

the

relay

node

from√ the

source

is

y1∗

=

r1∗ ∗

=

max{0, r1},

where

r1

=

1 ρ

log(

1 + eρL − 1). Hence, yL1 =

√

max{ λ1 log eλ + 1 − 1 , 0}. Now r1 ≥ 0 if and only

if λ ≥ log 3. Hence, y1∗ = 0 for λ ≤ log 3 and y1∗ =

√

L

L

λ1 log eλ + 1 − 1 for λ ≥ log 3.

For λ ≤ log 3, the relay is placed at the source. Then

g0,1

=1

and

g0,2

= g1,2

= e−λ.

Then

P0,1

= γ1

=

2PT eλ +1

(by

Theorem 4) and R∗ = C (eλ2+P1T)σ2 . Also γ2 = eeλλ−+11 PT .

Hence, P0,2 = P1,2 = eeλλ−+11 P2T .

for λ ≥ log 3, the relay is placed at r1. Substituting the value of r1 in√to (8), we obtain P0,1 = γ1 = P2T , P0,2 = √e1λ+1 P2T , P1,2 = √eλe+λ+1−1 1 P2T . So in this case R∗ = C g0,1σP20,1 . Since

P0,1 = P2T , we have R∗ = C √eλ1+1−1 2PσT2 .

C. Proof of Theorem 6

For the N -relay problem, let the minimizer in (12) be

z1∗, z2∗, · · · , zN∗

and

let

yk∗

=

1 ρ

log

zk∗.

Clearly,

there

exists

i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N } such that yi∗+1 > yi∗. Let us insert a new

relay at a distance y from the source such that yi∗ < y < yi∗+1.

Now we ﬁnd that we can easily reach (54) just by simple

comparison. For example,

ey − zi∗

zi∗+1 − ey

= 1 + z∗ + · · · + z∗

i

First i terms in the summations of L.H.S (left hand side) and R.H.S (right hand side) of (54) are identical. Also sum of the remaining terms in L.H.S is smaller than that of the R.H.S since there is an additional ey in the denominator of each fraction for the L.H.S. Hence, we can justify (54). Now R.H.S is precisely the optimum objective function for the N relay placement problem (12). On the other hand, L.H.S is a particular value of the objective in (12), for (N + 1)-relay placement problem. This clearly implies that by adding one additional relay we can strictly improve from R∗ of the N relay channel. Hence, R∗(N + 1) > R∗(N ).

D. Proof of Theorem 7

Consider the optimization problem (12). Let us consider
λ1, λ2, with λ1 < λ2, the respective minimizers being (z1∗, · · · , zN∗ ) and (z1, · · · , zN ). Clearly,

G(N, λ1) = z1∗ +

The second inequality follows from the fact that (z1, · · · , zN ) minimizes z1 + Nk=+21 zk−kl=−z0k1−z1l subject to the constraint 1 ≤ z1 ≤ z2 ≤ · · · ≤ zN ≤ zN+1 = eλ2 .
Hence, G(N, λ) is increasing in λ for ﬁxed N .

E. Proof of Theorem 8

When N relay nodes are uniformly placed along a line,

we will have yk = Nk+L1 . Then our formula for achievable

rate RPopTt(y1, y2, · · · , yN ) for total power constraint becomes

:

where

Since a > 1, we have :

Thus we obtain:

APPENDIX D OPTIMAL SEQUENTIAL PLACEMENT OF RELAY NODES ON
A LINE OF RANDOM LENGTH
As we have seen in Section V, our problem is a negative dynamic programming problem (i.e., the N case of [17], where

single-stage rewards are non-positive). It is to be noted that Schäl [17] discusses two other kind of problems as well: the P case (single-stage rewards are positive) and the D case (the reward at stage k is discounted by a factor αk, where 0 < α < 1). In this appendix, we ﬁrst state a general-purpose theorem for the value iteration, prove it by some results of [17], and then we use this theorem to prove Theorem 10.

A. A General Result (Derived from [17])
Consider an inﬁnite horizon total cost MDP whose state space S is an interval in R and the action space A is [0, ∞). Let the set of possible actions at state s be denoted by A(s). Let the single-stage cost be c(s, a, w) ≥ 0 where s, a and w are the state, the action and the disturbance, respectively. Let us denote the optimal expected cost-to-go at state s by V ∗(s). Let the state of the system evolve as sk+1 = h(sk, ak, wk), where sk, ak and wk are the state, the action and the disturbance at the k-th instant, respectively. Let s∗ ∈ S be an absorbing state with c(s∗, a, w) = 0 for all a, w. Let us consider the value iteration for all s ∈ S:

V (0)(s) = 0

V (k+1)(s) = inf Ew c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w)) , s = s∗
a∈[0,∞)

V (k+1)(s∗) = 0

(57)

We provide some results and concepts from [17], which will be used later to prove Theorem 10.
Theorem 11: [Theorem 4.2 ([17])] V (k)(s) → V (∞)(s) for all s ∈ S, i.e., the value iteration (57) converges.
Let us recall that Γk(s) is the set of minimizers of (57) at the k-th iteration at state s, if the inﬁmum is achieved at some a < ∞. Γ∞(s) := {a ∈ A : a is an accumulation point of some sequence {ak} where each ak ∈ Γk(s)}. Γ∗(s) is the set of minimizers in the Bellman Equation.
Theorem 12: If the value iteration (57) satisﬁes the following conditions:
(a) For each k, Ew c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w)) is jointly continuous in a and s for s = s∗.
(b) The inﬁmum in (57) is achieved in [0, ∞) for all s = s∗.
(c) For each s ∈ S, there exists a(s) < ∞ such that a(s) is continuous in s for s = s∗, and no minimizer of (57) lies in (a(s), ∞) for each k ≥ 0.

Let C(A) be the set of nonempty compact subsets of A. The Hausdorff metric d on C(A) is deﬁned as follows:

d(C1, C2) = max{ sup ρ(c, C2), sup ρ(c, C1)}

c∈C1

c∈C2

where ρ(c, C) is the minimum distance between the point c and the compact set C.

Proposition 6: [Proposition 9.1([17])] (C(A), d) is a separable metric space.

A mapping φ : S → C(A) is called measurable if it is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra of Borel subsets of (C(A), d).
Fˆ(S ×A) is the set of all measurable functions v : S ×A → R which are bounded below and where every such v(·) is the limit of a non-decreasing sequence of measurable, bounded functions vk : S × A → R.

We will next present a condition followed by a theorem. The condition, if satisﬁed, implies the convergence of value iteration (57) to the optimal value function (according to the theorem).

Condition 1: [Derived from Condition A in [17]]

(i) A(s) ∈ C(A) for all s ∈ S and A : S → C(A) is measurable.
(ii) Ew(c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w))) is in Fˆ(S × A) for all k ≥ 0.

Theorem 13: [Theorem 13.3, [17]] If c(s, a, w) ≥ 0 for all s, a, w and Condition 1 holds:
(i) V (∞)(s) = V ∗(s), s ∈ S. (ii) Γ∞(s) ⊂ Γ∗(s). (iii) There is a stationary optimal policy f ∞ where f : S → A
and f (s) ∈ Γ∞(s) for all s ∈ S.

original problem as well.

Proof of Theorem 12:

By Theorem 11, the value iteration converges, i.e., V (k)(s) → V (∞)(s). Moreover, V (k)(s) is the optimal cost
for a k-stage problem with zero terminal cost, and the cost at each stage is positive. Hence, V (k)(s) increases in k for every
s ∈ S. Thus, for all s ∈ S,

V (k)(s) ↑ V (∞)(s)

(58)

Now, Condition 2 and Theorem 14 say that if no optimizer of the value iteration in each stage k lies outside a compact subset A(s) of A(s) ⊂ A, then we can deal with the modiﬁed problem having a new action space A(s). If the value iteration converges to the optimal value in this modiﬁed problem, then it will converge to the optimal value in the original problem as well, provided that the mapping A : S → C(A) is measurable. Let us choose A(s) := [0, a(s)], where a(s) satisﬁes hypothesis (c) of Theorem 12. Since a(s) is continuous at s = s∗, for any > 0 we can ﬁnd a δs, > 0 such that |a(s) − a(s )| < whenever |s − s | < δs, , s = s∗, s = s∗. Now, when |a(s) − a(s )| < , we have d([0, a(s)], [0, a(s )]) < . Hence, the mapping A : S → C(A) is continuous at all s = s∗, and thereby measurable in this case. Hence, the value iteration (57) satisﬁes Condition 2.
Thus, the value iteration for s = s∗ can be modiﬁed as follows:
V (k+1)(s) = inf Ew c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w))
a∈[0,a(s)]
(59)
Now, Ew c(s, a, w)+V (k)(h(s, a, w)) is continuous (can
be discontinuous at s = s∗, since this quantity is 0 at
s = s∗) on S ×A (by our hypothesis). Hence, Ew c(s, a, w)+

But the requirement of compact action sets in Theorem 13 is often too restrictive. The next condition and theorem deal with the situation where the action space is noncompact.
Condition 2: [Condition B ([17])] There is a measurable mapping A : S → C(A) such that:
(i) A(s) ⊂ A(s) for all s ∈ S.

(ii) infa∈A(s)−A(s) Ew c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w))

>

infa∈A(s) Ew c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w)) for all k ≥ 0.

This condition requires that for each state s, there is a compact set A(s) of actions such that no optimizer of the value iteration lies outside the set A(s) at any stage k ≥ 0.
Theorem 14: [Theorem 17.1, [17]] If Condition 2 is satisﬁed and if the three statements in Theorem 13 are valid for the modiﬁed problem having admissible set of actions A(s) for each state s ∈ S, then those statements are valid for the

V (k)(h(s, a, w)) is measurable on S ×A. Also, it is bounded
below by 0. Hence, it can be approximated by an increasing sequence of bounded measurable functions {vn,k}n≥1 given by
vn,k(s, a) = min Ew c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w)) , n .
Hence, Ew c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w)) is in Fˆ(S × A).
Thus, Condition 1 is satisﬁed for the modiﬁed problem and therefore, by Theorem 13, the modiﬁed value iteration in (59) converges to the optimal value function. Now, by Theorem 14, we can argue that the value iteration (57) converges to the optimal value function in the original problem and hence V (∞)(s) = V ∗(s) for all s ∈ S \ s∗. Also, Γ∞(s) ⊂ Γ∗(s) for all s ∈ S \ s∗ and there exists a stationary optimal policy f ∞ where f (s) ∈ Γ∞(s) for all s ∈ S \ s∗ (by Theorem 13).

B. Proof of Theorem 10
This proof uses the results of Theorem 12 provided in this appendix. Remember that the state e is absorbing and c(e, a, w) = 0 for all a, w. We can think of it as state 0 so that our state space becomes [0, 1] which is a Borel set. We will see that the state 0 plays the role of the state s∗ as mentioned in Theorem 12.
We need to check whether the conditions (a), (b), and (c) in Theorem 12 are satisﬁed for the value iteration (24). Of course, Jξ(0)(s) = 0 is concave, increasing in s ∈ (0, 1]. Suppose that Jξ(k)(s) is concave, increasing in s for some k ≥ 0. Also, for any ﬁxed a ≥ 0, 1+sesρeaρa is concave and increasing in s. Thus, by the composition rule for the composition of a concave increasing function Jξ(k)(·) and a concave increasing function 1+sesρeaρa , for any a ≥ 0 the term Jξ(k) 1+sesρeaρa is concave, increasing over s ∈ (0, 1]. Hence, 0a βe−βzs(eρz − 1)dz + e−βa s(eρa − 1) + ξ + Jξ(k) 1+sesρeaρa (in (24)) is
concave increasing over s ∈ (0, 1]. Since the inﬁmization over a preserves concavity, we conclude that Jξ(k+1)(s) is concave, increasing over s ∈ (0, 1]. Hence, for each k, Jξ(k)(s) is continuous in s over (0, 1), since otherwise concavity w.r.t. s will be violated. Now, we must have Jξ(k)(1) ≤ lims↑1 Jξ(k)(s), since otherwise the concavity of Jξ(k)(s) will be violated. But since Jξ(k)(s) is increasing in s, Jξ(k)(1) ≥ lims↑1 Jξ(k)(s). Hence, Jξ(k)(1) = lims↑1 Jξ(k)(s). Thus, Jξ(k)(s) is continuous in s over (0, 1] for each k.
Hence, 0a βe−βzs(eρz − 1)dz + e−βa s(eρa − 1) + ξ +
Jξ(k)( 1+sesρeaρa ) is continuous in s, a for s = 0. Hence,
condition (a) in Theorem 12 is satisﬁed.
Now, we will check condition (c) in Theorem 12.
By Theorem 11, the value iteration converges, i.e., Jξ(k)(s) → Jξ(∞)(s). Also, Jξ(∞)(s) is concave, increasing in s ∈ (0, 1] and hence continuous. Moreover, Jξ(k)(s) is the optimal cost for a k-stage problem with zero terminal cost, and the cost at each stage is positive. Hence, Jξ(k)(s) increases in k for every s ∈ (0, 1]. Thus, for all s ∈ (0, 1],
Jξ(k)(s) ↑ Jξ(∞)(s) (60)
Again, Jξ(k)(s) is the optimal cost for a k-stage problem with zero terminal cost. Hence, it is less than or equal to the optimal cost for the inﬁnite horizon problem with the same transition law and cost structure. Hence, Jξ(k)(s) ≤ Jξ(s) for all k ≥ 1. Since Jξ(k)(s) ↑ Jξ(∞)(s), we have Jξ(∞)(s) ≤ Jξ(s).
Now, consider the following two cases:
1) β > ρ: Let us deﬁne a function ψ : (0, 1] → R by
J (∞)(s)+θs
ψ(s) = ξ 2 . By Proposition 1, Jξ(s) < θs for all s ∈ (0, 1]. Hence, Jξ(∞)(s) < ψ(s) < θs and ψ(s) is continuous over s ∈ (0, 1]. Since β > ρ and Jξ(k)(s) ∈ [0, θ] for any s in

(0, 1], the expression θs+e−βa −θseρa+ξ+Jξ(k) 1+sesρeaρa

obtained from the R.H.S of (24) converges to θs as a → ∞. A lower bound to this expression is θs + e−βa(−θseρa).
With β > ρ, for each s, there exists a(s) < ∞ such that θs + e−βa(−θseρa) > ψ(s) for all a > a(s). But

θs + infa≥0 e−βa

− θseρa + ξ + Jξ(k)

seρa 1+seρa

is equal to

Jξ(k+1)(s) < ψ(s). Hence, for any s ∈ (0, 1], the minimizers for (21) always lie in the compact interval [0, a(s)] for all
k ≥ 1. Since ψ(s) is continuous in s, we can choose a(s) as
a continuous function of s on (0, 1].

2) β ≤ ρ: Fix A, 0 < A < ∞. Let K := β1A ξ + (eρA − 1) + (eρA − 1). Then, by Proposition 2, Jξ(s) ≤ K for all s ∈ (0, 1]. Now, we observe that the
objective function (for minimization over a) in the R.H.S of (24) is lower bounded by 0a βe−βzs(eρz − 1)dz, which is continuous in s, a and goes to ∞ as a → ∞ for each s ∈ (0, 1].
Hence, for each s ∈ (0, 1], there exists 0 < a(s) < ∞ such that 0a βse−βz(eρz − 1)dz > 2K for all a > a(s) and a(s) is continuous over s ∈ (0, 1]. But Jξ(k+1)(s) ≤ Jξ(s) ≤ K for all k. Hence, the minimizers in (24) always lie in [0, a(s)]
where a(s) is independent of k and continuous over s ∈ (0, 1].

Let us set a(0) = a(1).8 Then, the chosen function a(s) is continuous over s ∈ (0, 1] and can be discontinuous only at s = 0. Thus, condition (c) of Theorem 12 has been veriﬁed for the value iteration (24). Condition (b) of Theorem 12 is obviously satisﬁed since a continuous function over a compact set always has a minimizer.

Remark: Observe that in our value iteration (24) it is always
sufﬁcient to deal with compact action spaces, and the objective
functions to be minimized at each stage of the value iteration
are continuous in s, a. Hence, Γk(s) is nonempty for each s ∈ (0, 1], k ≥ 0. Also, since there exists K > 0 such that Jξ(k)(s) ≤ K for all k ≥ 0, s ∈ (0, 1], it is sufﬁcient to restrict the action space in (24) to a set [0, a(s)] for any s ∈ (0, 1],
k ≥ 0. Hence, Γk(s) ⊂ [0, a(s)] for all s ∈ (0, 1], k ≥ 0. Now, for a ﬁxed s ∈ (0, 1], any sequence {ak}k≥0 with ak ∈ Γk(s), in bounded. Hence, the sequence must have a limit point. Hence, Γ∞(s) is nonempty for each s ∈ (0, 1]. Since Γ∞(s) ⊂ Γ∗(s), Γ∗(s) is nonempty for each s ∈ (0, 1].

C. Proofs of Propositions 3, 4 and 5
1) Proof of Proposition 3: Fix ξ. Consider the value iteration (24). Let us start with Jξ(0)(s) := 0 for all s ∈ (0, 1]. Clearly, Jξ(1)(s) is concave and increasing in s, since pointwise inﬁmum of linear functions is concave. Now let us assume that Jξ(k)(s) is concave and increasing in s. Then, by the composition rule, it is easy to show that Jξ(k)( 1+sesρeaρa ) is concave and increasing in s for any ﬁxed a ≥ 0. Hence, Jξ(k+1)(s) is concave and increasing, since pointwise inﬁmum of a set of concave and increasing functions is concave and
8Remember that at state 0 (i.e., state e), the single stage cost is 0 irrespective of the action, and that this state is absorbing. Hence, any action at state 0 can be optimal.

increasing. By Theorem 10, Jξ(k)(s) → Jξ(s). Hence, Jξ(s) is concave and increasing in s.
2) Proof of Proposition 4: Consider the value iteration (24). Since Jξ(0)(s) := 0 for all s ∈ (0, 1], Jξ(1)(s) is obtained by taking inﬁmum (over a) of a linear, increasing function of ξ. Hence, Jξ(1)(s) is concave, increasing over ξ ∈ (0, ∞). If we assume that Jξ(k)(s) is concave and increasing in ξ, then Jξ(k)( 1+sesρeaρa ) is also concave and increasing in ξ for ﬁxed s and a. Thus, Jξ(k+1)(s) is also concave and increasing in ξ. Now, Jξ(k)(s) → Jξ(s) for all s ∈ S, and Jξ(k)(s) is concave, increasing in ξ for all k ≥ 0, s ∈ S. Hence, Jξ(s) is concave and increasing in ξ.
3) Proof of Proposition 5: Clearly, Jξ(s) is continuous in s over (0, 1), since otherwise concavity w.r.t. s will be violated.
Now, since Jξ(s) is concave in s over (0, 1], we must have Jξ(1) ≤ lims↑1 Jξ(s). But since Jξ(s) is increasing in s, Jξ(1) ≥ lims↑1 Jξ(s). Hence, Jξ(1) = lims↑1 Jξ(s). Thus, Jξ(s) is continuous in s over (0, 1].
Again, for a ﬁxed s ∈ (0, 1], Jξ(s) is concave and increasing in ξ. Hence, Jξ(s) is continuous in ξ over ξ ∈ (0, c), ∀ c > 0. Hence, Jξ(s) is continuous in ξ over (0, ∞).
