Deploy-As-You-Go Wireless Relay Placement: An Optimal Sequential Decision Approach using
the Multi-Relay Channel Model
Arpan Chattopadhyay, Abhishek Sinha, Marceau Coupechoux, and Anurag Kumar Fellow, IEEE
Abstract—We use information theoretic achievable rate formulas for the multi-relay channel to study the problem of as-you-go deployment of relay nodes. The achievable rate formulas are for full-duplex radios at the relays and for decode-and-forward relaying. Deployment is done along the straight line joining a source node and a sink node at an unknown distance from the source. The problem is for a deployment agent to walk from the source to the sink, deploying relays as he walks, given the knowledge of the wireless pathloss model, and given that the distance to the sink node is exponentially distributed with known mean. As a precursor to the formulation of the deploy-as-you-go problem, we apply the multi-relay channel achievable rate formula to obtain the optimal power allocation to relays placed along a line, at ﬁxed locations. This permits us to obtain the optimal placement of a given number of nodes when the distance between the source and sink is given. Numerical work for the ﬁxed source-sink distance case suggests that, at low attenuation, the relays are mostly clustered close to the source in order to be able to cooperate among themselves, whereas at high attenuation they are uniformly placed and work as repeaters. We also prove that the effect of path-loss can be entirely mitigated if a large enough number of relays are placed uniformly between the source and the sink. The structure of the optimal power allocation for a given placement of the nodes, then motivates us to formulate the problem of as-you-go placement of relays along a line of exponentially distributed length, and with the exponential path-loss model, so as to minimize a cost function that is additive over hops. The hop cost trades off a capacity limiting term, motivated from the optimal power allocation solution, against the cost of adding a relay node. We formulate the problem as a total cost Markov decision process, establish results for the value function, and provide insights into the placement policy and the performance of the deployed network via numerical exploration.

1 INTRODUCTION
Wireless interconnection of devices such as smart phones, or wireless sensors, to the wireline communication infrastructure is an important requirement. These are battery operated, resource constrained devices. Hence, due to the physical placement of these devices, or due to channel conditions, a direct one-hop link to the infrastructure “base-station” might not be feasible. In such situations, other nodes could serve as relays in order to realize a multi-hop path between the source device and the infrastructure. In the wireless sensor network context, the relays could be other wireless sensors or battery operated radio routers deployed speciﬁcally as relays. The relays are also resource constrained and a

cost might be involved in placing them. Hence, there arises the problem of optimal relay placement. Such a problem involves the joint optimization of node placement and operation of the resulting network, where by “operation” we mean activities such as transmission scheduling, power allocation, and channel coding.
Our work in this paper is motivated by recent interest in problems of impromptu (as-you-go) deployment of wireless relay networks in various situations; for example, “ﬁrst responders” in emergency situations, or quick deployment (and redeployment) of sensor networks in large terrains, such as forests (see [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]). In this paper, we are concerned with the situation in which a deployment agent walks from the source node to the sink node, along the line joining these two nodes, and places wireless relays (in an “as-you-go” manner) so as to create a source-to-sink multi-relay channel network with high data rate; see Figure 1. We ﬁrst consider the scenario where the length L of the line in Figure 1 is known; the results of this case are used to formulate the as-you-go deployment in the case where L is a priori unknown, but has exponential distribution with known mean L.

2

In order to capture the fundamental trade-offs involved in such problems, we consider an information theoretic model. For a placement of the relay nodes and allocation of transmission powers to these relays, we model the “quality” of communication between the source and the sink by the information theoretic achievable rate of the multi-relay channel (see [8], [9] and [10] for the single and multi-relay channel models). The relays are equipped with full-duplex radios1, and carry out decode-and-forward relaying. We consider scalar, memoryless, time-invariant, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. We assume synchronous operation across all transmitters and receivers, and consider the exponential path-loss model for radio wave propagation.
1.1 Related Work
A formulation of the relay placement problem requires a model of the wireless network at the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers. Most researchers have adopted the link scheduling and interference model, i.e., a scheduling algorithm determines radio resource allocation (channel and power) and interference is treated as noise (see [15]); treating interference as noise leads to the model that simultaneous transmissions “collide” at receiving nodes, and transmission scheduling aims to avoid collisions.
However, node placement for throughput maximization with this model is intractable because the optimal throughput is obtained by ﬁrst solving for the optimum schedule assuming ﬁxed node locations, followed by an optimization over those locations. Hence, with such a model, there appears to be little work on the problem of jointly optimizing the relay node placement and the transmission schedule. Reference [16] is one such work where the authors considered placing a set of nodes in an existing network such that a certain network utility is optimized subject to a set of linear constraints on link rates, under the link scheduling and interference model. They posed the problem as one of geometric programming assuming exponential path-loss, and proposed a distributed solution. The authors of [17] consider relay placement for utility maximization, assuming there are several source nodes, sink nodes and a few candidate locations for placing relays; they ignore interference because of highly directional antennas used in 60 GHz mmWave networks, which may not always be valid. Relay placement for capacity enhancement has been studied in [18], but there interference is mitigated by scheduling transmissions over multiple channels.
On the other hand, an information theoretic model for a wireless network often provides a closed-form expression for the channel capacity, or at least an achievable rate region. These results are asymptotic, and make idealized assumptions such as full-duplex radios, perfect interference cancellation, etc., but provide algebraic expressions that can be used to formulate tractable optimization problems which can provide useful insights. In

the context of optimal relay placement, some researchers have already exploited this approach. Thakur et al., in [19], report on the problem of placing a single relay node to maximize the capacity of a broadcast relay channel in a wideband regime. Lin et al., in [20], numerically solve the problem of a single relay node placement, under power-law path loss and individual power constraints at the source and the relay; however, our work is primarily focused on multi-relay placement, under the exponential path-loss model and a sum power constraint among the nodes. The linear deterministic channel model ([21]) is used by Appuswamy et al. in [22] to study the problem of placing two or more relay nodes along a line so as to maximize the end-to-end data rate. Our present paper is in a similar spirit; however, we use the achievable rate formulas for the N -relay channel (with decode and forward relays) to study the problem of placing relays on a line having length L, under a sum power constraint over the nodes.
The most important difference of our paper with the literature reported above is that we address the problem of sequential placement of relay nodes along a line of an unknown random length. This paper extends our previous work in [1], which presents the analysis for the case of given L and N ; the study under given L and N is a precursor to the formulation of as-you-go deployment problem, since it motivates an additive cost structure that is essential for the formulation of the sequential deployment problem as a Markov decision process (MDP).
The deploy-as-you-go problem has been addressed by previous researchers. For example, Howard et al., in [4], provide heuristic algorithms for incremental deployment of sensors in order to cover a deployment area. Souryal et al., in [3], propose heuristic deployment algorithms for the problem of impromptu wireless network deployment, with an experimental study of indoor RF link quality variation. The authors of [5] propose a collaborative deployment method for multiple deployment agents, so that the contiguous coverage area of relays is maximized subject to a total number of relays constraint. However, until the work in [23] and [6], there appears to have been no effort to rigorously formulate as-yougo deployment problem in order to derive optimal deployment algorithms. The authors of [23] and [6] used MDP based formulations to address the problem of placing relay nodes sequentially along a line and along a random lattice path, respectively. The formulations in [23] and [6] are based on the so-called “lone packet trafﬁc model" under which, at any time instant, there can be no more than one packet traversing the network, thereby eliminating contention between wireless links. This work was later extended in [7] to the scenario where the trafﬁc is still lone packet, but a measurement-based approach is employed to account for the spatial variation of link qualities due to shadowing.
In this paper, we consider as-you-go deployment along a line, but move away from the lone-packet trafﬁc

assumption by employing information theoretic achievable rate formulas (for full-duplex radios and decodeand-forward relaying). We assume exponential path-loss model (see [24] and Section 6.1). To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work that considers as-yougo deployment under this physical layer model.
1.2 Our Contribution
• Optimal Ofﬂine Deployment: Given the location of N full-duplex relays to connect a source and a sink separated by a given distance L, and under the exponential path-loss model and a sum power constraint among the nodes, the optimal power split among the nodes and the achievable rate are expressed (Theorem 1) in terms of the channel gains. We ﬁnd expression for optimal relay location in the single relay placement problem (Theorem 2). For the N relay placement problem, numerical study shows that, the relay nodes are clustered near the source at low attenuation and are placed uniformly at high attenuation. Theorem 5 shows that, by placing large number of relays uniformly, we can achieve a rate arbitrarily close to the AWGN capacity. Only this part of our current paper was published in the conference version [1].
• Optimal As-You-Go Deployment: In Section 4, we consider the problem of placing relay nodes in a deploy-as-you-go manner, so as to connect a source and a sink separated by an unknown distance, modeled as an exponentially distributed random variable L. Speciﬁcally, the problem is to start from a source, and walk along a line, placing relay nodes as we go, until the line ends, at which point the sink is placed. With a sum power constraint, the aim is to maximize a capacity limiting term derived from the deployment problem for known L, while constraining the expected number of relays. We “relax” the expected number of relays constraint via a Lagrange multiplier, and formulate the problem as a total cost MDP with uncountable state space and non-compact action sets. We prove the existence of an optimal policy and convergence of value iteration (Theorem 7); these results for uncountable state space and non-compact action space are not evident from standard literature. We study properties of the value function analytically. This is the ﬁrst time that the as-you-go deployment problem is formulated to maximize the end-to-end data rate under the fullduplex multi-relay channel model.
• Numerical Results on As-You-Go Deployment: In Section 5, we study the policy structure numerically. We also demonstrate numerically that the proposed as-you-go algorithm achieves an end-toend data rate sufﬁciently close to the maximum possible achievable data rate for ofﬂine placement. This is particularly important since there is no other benchmark in the literature, with which we can make a fair comparison of our policy.

1.3 Organization of the Paper
In Section 2, we describe our system model and notation. In Section 3, we address the problem of relay placement on a line of known length. Section 4 deals with the problem of as-you-go deployment along a line of unknown random length. Numerical work on as-yougo deployment has been presented in Section 5. Some discussions are provided in Section 6. Conclusions are drawn in Section 7.

2 SYSTEM MODEL AND NOTATION
2.1 The Multi-Relay Channel
The multi-relay channel was studied in [10] and [9] and is an extension of the single relay model presented in [8]. We consider a network deployed on a line with a source node and a sink node at the end of the line, and N full-duplex relay nodes as shown in Figure 1. The relay nodes are numbered as 1, 2, · · · , N . The source and sink are indexed by 0 and N + 1, respectively. The distance of the k-th node from the source is denoted by yk := r1 +r2 + · · · + rk. Thus, yN+1 = L. As in [10] and [9], we consider the scalar, time-invariant, memoryless, AWGN setting.
We use the model that a symbol transmitted by node i is received at node j after multiplication by the (positive, real valued) channel gain hi,j (an assumption often made in the literature, see e.g., [10] and [25]). The power gain from Node i to Node j is denoted by gi,j = h2i,j. We deﬁne gi,i = 1 and hi,i = 1. The Gaussian additive noise at any receiver is independent and identically distributed from symbol to symbol and has variance σ2.
2.2 An Inner Bound to the Capacity
For the multi-relay channel, we denote the symbol transmitted by the i-th node at time t (t is discrete) by Xi(t) for i = 0, 1, · · · , N . Zk(t) ∼ N (0, σ2) is the additive white Gaussian noise at node k and time t, and is assumed to be independent and identically distributed across k and t. Thus, at symbol time t, node k, 1 ≤ k ≤ N + 1 receives:

Yk(t) =

hj,kXj (t) + Zk(t)

(1)

j∈{0,1,··· ,N },j=k

An inner bound to the capacity of this network, under any path-loss model, is given by (see [10]):

In Appendix A, we provide a descriptive overview of

the coding and decoding scheme proposed in [10]. A

sequence of messages are sent from the source to the

sink; each message is encoded in a block of symbols

and transmitted by using the relay nodes. The scheme

involves coherent transmission by the source and relay

4

nodes (this requires symbol-level synchronization among the nodes), and successive interference cancellation at the relay nodes and the sink. A node receives information about a message in two ways (i) by the message being directed to it cooperatively by all the previous nodes, and (ii) by overhearing previous transmissions of the message to the previous nodes. Thus node k receives codes corresponding to a message k times before it attempts to decode the message (a discussion on the practical feasibility of full-duplex decode-and-forward relaying scheme is provided in Section 6.3). Note that,

C

kj=1(

j−1 i=0

Pi,j )2

in (2), for any k, denotes

a possible rate that can be achieved by node k from the transmissions from nodes 0, 1, · · · , k − 1. The smallest of these terms becomes the bottleneck, see (2).
For the single relay channel, N = 1. Thus, by (2), an achievable rate is given by (see also [8]):

R = min

C g0,1P0,1 , σ2

g0,2P0,1 + (h0,2 P0,2 + h1,2 P1,2)2

C σ2

(3)

Here, the ﬁrst term in the min{·, ·} of (3) is the achievable rate at node 1 (i.e., the relay node) due to the transmission from the source. The second term in the min{·, ·} corresponds to the possible achievable rate at the sink node due to direct coherent transmission from the source and the relay and due to the overheard transmission from the source to the relay. The higher the channel attenuation, the less will be the contribution of farther nodes, “overheard” transmissions become less relevant, and coherent transmission reduces to a simple transmission from the previous relay. The system is then closer to simple store-and-forward relaying.
The authors of [10] have shown that any rate strictly less than R is achievable through the coding and decoding scheme. This achievable rate formula can also be obtained from the capacity formula of a physically degraded multi-relay channel (see [9]), since the capacity of the degraded relay channel is a lower bound to the actual channel capacity. In this paper, we will seek to optimize R in (2) over power allocations to the nodes and the node locations, keeping in mind that R is a lower bound to the actual capacity. We denote the value of R optimized over power allocation and relay locations by R∗.

2.3 Path-Loss Model
We model the power gain via the exponential path-loss model: the power gain at a distance r is e−ρr where ρ > 0. This is a simple model used for tractability (see [16], [22]) and [26, Section 2.3] for prior work assuming exponential path-loss). However, for propagation scenarios involving randomly placed scatterers (as would be the case in a dense urban environment, or a forest, for example) analytical and experimental support has been provided for the exponential path-loss model (a discussion has been provided in Section 6.1). We also

discuss in Section 6.4 how the insights obtained from the results for exponential path-loss can be used for powerlaw path-loss (power gain at a distance r is r−η, η > 0). Deployment with other path-loss models is left in this paper as a possible future work.
Under exponential path-loss, the channel gains and power gains in the line network become multiplicative, e.g., hi,i+2 = hi,i+1hi+1,i+2 and gi,i+2 = gi,i+1gi+1,i+2 for i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N − 1}.
We discuss in Section 6.2 how shadowing and fading can be taken care of in our model, by providing a fademargin in the power at each transmitter.

2.4 Motivation for the Sum Power Constraint

In this paper we consider the sum power constraint

N i=0

Pi

PT

(in

mW)

over

the

source

and

the

relays.

This constraint has the following motivation. Let the

ﬁxed power expended in a relay (for reception and driv-

ing the electronic circuits) be denoted by Prcv (expressed

in mW), and the initial battery energy in each node be

denoted by E (in mJ unit). The information theoretic

approach utilized in this paper requires that the nodes in

the network are always on. Hence, the lifetime of node

i, 1 ≤ i ≤ N , is τi = Pi+EPrcv , the lifetime of the source is τ0 = PE0 , and that of the sink is τN+1 = PErcv . The rate of battery replacement at node i is τ1i . Hence, the rate at which we have to replace the batteries in the

network is Ni=+01 τ1i = E1 ( Ni=0 Pi + (N + 1)Prcv). The

depletion

rate

Prcv E

is

inevitable

at

any

node,

and

it

does

not affect the achievable data rate. Hence, in order to

reduce the battery replacement rate, we must reduce the

sum transmit power in the entire network.

3 PLACEMENT ON A LINE OF KNOWN LENGTH
As a precursor to addressing the deploy-as-you-go problem over a line of unknown length, in this section we solve the problem of power constrained deployment of a given number of relays on a line of known length. We will often refer to this problem as ofﬂine deployment problem. The results of this section provide (i) ﬁrst insights into the relay placements we obtain using the multi-relay channel model, (ii) a starting point for the formulation of as-you-go deployment problem, and (iii) a benchmark with which we can compare the performance of our asyou-go deployment algorithm.

3.1 Optimal Power Allocation

In this section, we consider the optimal placement of

relay nodes on a line of given length, L, so as to to

maximize R (see (2)), subject to a total power constraint

on the source and relay nodes given by

N i=0

Pi

=

PT .

We will ﬁrst maximize R in (2) over Pi,j, 0 ≤ i <

j ≤ (N + 1) for any given placement of nodes (i.e.,

given y1, y2, · · · , yN ). This will provide an expression of

achievable rate in terms of channel gains, which has to

be maximized over y1, y2, · · · , yN . Let γk :=

k−1 i=0

Pi,k

for k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1} (expressed in mW). Hence, the

sum power constraint becomes

Proof: The basic idea is to choose the power levels (i.e., Pi,j, 0 ≤ i < j ≤ N + 1) in (2) so that all the terms in the min{·} in (2) become equal. We provide explicit expressions for Pi,j, 0 ≤ i < j ≤ N +1 and the achievable rate (optimized over power allocation) in terms of the power gains. See Appendix B for the detailed proof. A result on the equality of certain terms under optimal power allocation has also been proved in [9] for the coding scheme used in [9]. But it was proved in the context of a degraded Gaussian multi-relay channel, and the proof depends on an inductive argument, whereas our proof utilizes LP (linear programming) duality.

Recalling the exponential path-loss parameter ρ, and the source-sink distance L, let us deﬁne λ := ρL, which can be treated as a measure of attenuation in the line.

Let us now comment on the results of Theorem 1:

• In order to maximize RPopTt(y1, y2, · · · , yN ), we need to place the relay nodes such that g01,1 +

is minimized. This quantity

0,l

is viewed as the net attenuation the power PT faces.

• When no relay is placed, the attenuation is eλ. The

ratio of attenuation with no relay and attenuation

with relays is called the “relaying gain” G(N, λ).

Also, note that G(N, λ) does not depend on PT .

that g0,k is nonincreasing in k. If there exists some

1)-st nodes are placed at the same position, then γk+1 = 0, i.e., the nodes i < k do not direct any power speciﬁcally to relay k + 1. However, relay k + 1 can decode the symbols received at relay k, and those transmitted by relay k. Then relay (k + 1) can transmit coherently with the nodes l ≤ k to improve effective received power in the nodes j > k + 1.

3.2 Optimal Placement of a Single Relay Node

In the following theorem, we derive the optimal power

allocation, node location and data rate when a single

relay is placed.

Theorem 2: For the single relay node placement prob-

lem with sum power constraint and exponential pathloss model, the normalized optimum relay location yL1∗ , power allocation and optimized achievable rate are

given as follows:2

Theorem 2 is strictly greater than the AWGN capacity

for all λ > 0. This happens because the source

and relay transmit coherently to the sink. R∗ becomes

equal to the AWGN capacity only at λ = 0. At λ = 0,

we do not use the relay since the sink can decode any

message that the relay is able to decode. The variation of yL1∗ and PP0T,1 with λ has been shown in
Figure 2. We observe that (from Figure 2 and Theorem 2) limλ→∞ yL1∗ = 21 , limλ→∞ P0,2 = 0 and limλ→0 P0,1 = PT . For large values of λ, source and relay cooperation pro-

vides negligible beneﬁt since source to sink attenuation is

very high. So it is optimal to place the relay at a distance L2 . The relay works as a repeater which forwards data received from the source to the sink. For small λ, the

gain obtained from coherent transmission is dominant,

and, in order to receive sufﬁcient information (required

for coherent transmission) from the source, the relay is

placed near the source.

fractionals, and the constraints are linear.

Remark: From optimization problem (8) we observe

that optimum z1, z2, · · · , zN depend only on λ := ρL.

with the number of relay nodes.

G(N, λ) is increasing in λ.

Figure 3.

We observe that at low attenuation (small λ), relay

nodes are clustered near the source node and are often

at the source node, whereas at high attenuation (large λ)

they are almost uniformly placed along the line. For large

λ, the effect of long distance between any two adjacent

nodes dominates the gain obtained by coherent relaying.

Hence, it is beneﬁcial to minimize the maximum distance

between any two adjacent nodes and thus multihopping

is a better strategy in this case. For small λ, the gain

obtained by coherent transmission is dominant. In order

to allow this, relays should be able to receive sufﬁcient

information from their previous nodes. Thus, they tend

to be clustered near the source.

In Figure 4 we plot the relaying gain G(N, λ) in dB

vs. the number of relays N , for various values of λ. As

proved in Theorem 3, we see that G(N, λ) increases with

N for ﬁxed λ. On the other hand, G(N, λ) increases with

λ for ﬁxed N , as proved in Theorem 4.

3.4 Uniformly Placed Relays, Large N

When the relays are uniformly placed, the behaviour of RPopTt(y1, · · · , yN ) (called RN in the next theorem) for large number of relays is captured by the following:

Theorem 5: For exponential path-loss and sum power

constraint, if N relay nodes are placed uniformly be-

tween the source and the sink, resulting in RN achiev-

able rate, then limN→∞ RN = C

PT σ2

.

Proof: See Appendix F.

Remark: From Theorem 5, it is clear that we can achieve

a

rate

arbitrarily

close

to

C

(

PT σ2

)

(i.e.,

the

effect

of

path-

loss can completely be mitigated) by placing a large

enough number of relay nodes. In this context, we

would like to mention that the variation of broadcast

capacity as a function of the number of nodes N (located

randomly inside a unit square) was studied in [27]; but

the broadcast capacity in their paper increases with N

since they assume per-node power constraint.

4 AS-YOU-GO DEPLOYMENT OF RELAYS ON A LINE OF UNKNOWN LENGTH

Having developed the problem of placing a given num-

ber of relays over a line of ﬁxed, given length, we

now turn to the deploy-as-you-go problem. An agent

walks along a line, starting from the source and heading

towards the sink which is at an unknown distance from

the source location, deploying relays as he goes, so as

to achieve a multi-relay network when he encounters

the sink location (and places the sink there). We model

the distance from the source to sink as an exponentially

distributed

random

variable

with

mean

L

=

1 β

.3

The

deployment objective is to achieve a high data rate

from the source to the sink, subject to a total power

constraint and a constraint on the expected number of

relays placed (note that, the number of relay nodes, N ,

is a random variable here, due to the randomness in L).

3. A motivation for the use of the exponential distribution, given
the prior knowledge of the mean length L, is that it is the maximum entropy continuous probability density function with the given mean. By using the exponential distribution, we are leaving the length of the line as uncertain as we can, given the prior knowledge of its mean.

7

Using the rate expression from Theorem 1, we formulate the problem as a total cost MDP.
Such a deployment problem could be motivated by a situation where it is required to place a sensor (say, a video camera) to monitor an event or an object from a safe distance (e.g., the battlefront in urban combat, or a suspicious object that needs to be detonated, or a group of animals in a forest). In such a situation, the deployment agent, after placing the sensor, walk away from the scene of the event, along a forest trail, or a road, or a building corridor, placing relays as he walks, until a suitable safe sink location is found, in such a way that the number of relays is kept small while the end-to-end data rate is maximized.

4.1 Formulation as an MDP
We now formulate the as-you-go deployment problem as an MDP.

4.1.1 Deployment Policies
In the as-you-go placement problem, the person carries a number of nodes and places them as he walks, under the control of a placement policy. A deployment policy π is a sequence of mappings {µ1, µ2, µ3, · · · } from the state space to the action space; at the k-th decision instant (i.e., after placing the (k−1)-st relay), µk provides the distance at which the next relay should be placed (provided that the line does not end before that point), given the system state which is a function of the locations of previously placed nodes. Thus, the decisions are made based on the locations of the relays placed earlier. The ﬁrst decision instant is the start of the line, and the subsequent decision instants are the placement points of the relays. Let Π denote the set (possibly uncountable) of all deployment policies. Let Eπ denote the expectation under policy π.

4.1.2 The Unconstrained Problem

We recall from (6) that for a ﬁxed length L of the line

and a ﬁxed N , eρy1 +

N +1

eρyk −eρyk−1

k=2 1+eρy1 +···+eρyk−1

has to be

minimized in order to maximize RPopt(y1, y2, · · · , yN ).

eρy1 + Nk=+21 1+eeρρyy1k+−·e··ρ+yke− ρy1k−1 is basicallTy a scaling factor

which captures the effect of attenuation and relaying on

the

maximum

possible

SNR

PT σ2

.

Let ξ > 0 be the cost of placing a relay. We are

interested in solving the following problem:

inf Eπ

N +1
eρy1 +

eρyk − eρyk−1

+ ξN (9)

π∈Π

1 + eρy1 + · · · + eρyk−1

k=2

The “cost” function inside the outer parentheses in (9) has two terms, one is the denominator of G(N, λ) in (7), and the other is a linear multiple of the number of relays. Thus, the cost function captures the tradeoff between the cost of placing relays (quantiﬁed as ξ per relay), and the need to achieve high end-to-end data rate by making the denominator of G(N, λ) small. Note that, due to the

randomness in the length of the line, the yk, k ≥ 1, and N are all random variables.4
We will see in Theorem 7 that an optimal policy always
exists for this problem.

4.1.3 The Constrained Problem
Solving the problem in (9) also helps in solving the following constrained problem:

inf Eπ
π∈Π

N +1
eρy1 +

eρyk − eρyk−1

1 + eρy1 + · · · + eρyk−1

k=2

s.t., Eπ(N ) ≤ M

(10)

where M > 0 is a constraint on the expected number of relays. 5 The following standard result (see [28, Theorem 4.3]) gives the optimal ξ∗:
Lemma 1: If there exists ξ∗ > 0 and a policy πξ∗∗ ∈ Π such that πξ∗∗ is an optimal policy for the unconstrained problem (9) under ξ∗ and Eπξ∗∗ N = M , then πξ∗∗ is also optimal for the constrained problem (10).
The motivation behind formulation (10) is as follows.
Suppose that one seeks to solve the following problem:

supπEπ log2 1 + eρy1 +
s.t., Eπ(N ) ≤ M

PT σ2

N +1

eρyk −eρyk−1

k=2 1+eρy1 +···+eρyk−1

(11)

Since log2(1 + x1 ) is convex in x, we can argue by Jensen’s inequality that by solving (10) we actually ﬁnd a relay placement policy that maximizes a lower bound to the expected achievable data rate obtained from (11). But formulation (10) (and hence formulation (9), by Lemma 1) allows us to write the objective function as a summation of hop-costs; this motivates us to formulate the as-you-go deployment problem as an MDP, resulting in a substantial reduction in policy computation. However, in Section 5, we will show numerically that solving (10) is a reasonable approach to deal with the computational complexity of (11); we will see that formulation (10) allows us to achieve a reasonable performance.
We now formulate the above “as-you-go" relay placement problem (9) as a total cost Markov decision process.

4.1.4 State Space, Action Space and Cost Structure
Let us deﬁne s0 := 1, sk := 1+eρy1e+ρy·k··+eρyk ∀ k ≥ 1. Also, recall that rk+1 = yk+1 − yk. Thus, we can rewrite (9) as:

N

inf Eπ 1 + sk(eρrk+1 − 1) + ξN

(12)

π∈Π

k=0

When the person starts walking from the source along the line, the state of the system is set to s0 := 1. At

4. Recall Section 2.4. The battery depletion rate PrEcv of a node due to the receive power alone can be absorbed into the relay cost ξ.
5. The constraint on the mean number of relays can be justiﬁed if we consider the relay deployment problem for multiple source-sink pairs over several lines of mean length L, given a large pool of relays, and we are only interested in keeping small the total number of relays over all these deployments.

8

this instant the placement policy provides the location at which the ﬁrst relay should be placed. The person walks towards the prescribed placement point. If the sink placement location is encountered before reaching this point, the sink is placed; if not, then the ﬁrst relay is placed at the placement point. In general, the state after placing the k-th relay is denoted by sk (a function of the location of the nodes up to the k-th instant), for k = 1, 2, · · · . At state sk, the action is the distance rk+1 where the next relay has to be placed (action ∞ means that no further relay will be placed). If the line ends before this distance, the sink node has to be placed at the end. The randomness is coming from the random residual length of the line. Let lk denote the residual length at the k-th instant.
With this notation, the state of the system evolves as:

sk+1 =

1+sksekρerρkr+k+ 1 1 , if lk > rk+1,

EOL,

else.

(13)

Here EOL denotes the end of the line, i.e., the termination state.
The single stage cost (for problem (12)) for state s, action a and residual length l, is:

ξ + s(eρa − 1), if l > a,

c(s, a, l) = s(eρl − 1), else.

(14)

Also, c(EOL, a, ·) = 0 for all a.

From (13), it is clear that the next state sk+1 depends

on the current state sk, the current action rk+1 and the

residual length of the line. Since the length of the line

is exponentially distributed, from any placement point,

the residual line length is exponentially distributed, and

independent of the history of the process. The cost

incurred at the k-th decision instant is given by (14),

which depends on sk, rk+1 and lk.

Hence, our formulation in (12) is an MDP with state

space S := (0, 1] ∪ {EOL} and action space A ∪ {∞}

where A := [0, ∞).

Remark: An optimal policy (if it exists) for the problem

(9) will be used to place relay nodes along a line whose

length is a sample from an exponential distribution with

mean

1 β

.

After

the

deployment

is

over,

the

power

PT

will

be shared optimally among the source and the deployed

relay nodes (according to Theorem 1).

4.2 Optimal Value Function Suppose sk = s for some k ≥ 0. Then, the optimal value function (cost-to-go) at state s is deﬁned by:

Jξ(s) = inf E
π∈Π

∞
c(sn, an, ln)|sk = s
n=k

If we decide to place the next relay at a distance a < ∞ and follow the optimal policy thereafter, the expected cost-to-go at a state s ∈ (0, 1] becomes:

The ﬁrst term in (15) corresponds to the case in which the line ends at a distance less than a and we are forced to place the sink node. The second term corresponds to the case where the residual length of the line is greater than a and a relay is placed at a distance a.
Note that our MDP has an uncountable state space S = (0, 1] ∪ {EOL} and a non-compact action space A = [0, ∞) ∪ {∞}. Several technical issues arise in this kind of problems, such as the existence of optimal or optimal policies, measurability of the policies, etc. We, therefore, invoke the results provided by Schäl [29], which deal with such issues. Our problem is one of minimizing total, undiscounted, non-negative costs over an inﬁnite horizon. Equivalently, in the context of [29], we have a problem of total reward maximization where the rewards are the negative of the costs. Thus, our problem speciﬁcally ﬁts into the negative dynamic programming setting of [29] (i.e., the N case where single-stage rewards are non-positive).
Now, the state EOL is absorbing. Also, no action is taken at this state and the cost at this state is 0. Hence, we can think of this state as state 0 in order to make our state space a Borel subset of the real line.
Theorem 6: [[29], Equation (3.6)] The optimal value function Jξ(·) satisﬁes the Bellman equation.
Thus, Jξ(·) satisﬁes the following Bellman equation for each s ∈ (0, 1]:

Jξ(s) = min inf

∞
βe−βz s(eρz − 1)dz

, (16)

where the second term inside min{·, ·} is the cost of not placing any relay (i.e., a = ∞).
We analyze the MDP for β > ρ and β ≤ ρ.

4.2.1 Case I (β > ρ)

We observe that the cost of not placing any relay (i.e., a = ∞) at state s ∈ (0, 1] is given by:

∞
βe−βzs(eρz − 1)dz = θs
0

where

θ

:=

ρ β−ρ

(using

the

fact

that

β

>

ρ).

Since

not

placing a relay (i.e., a = ∞) is a possible action for every

s, it follows that Jξ(s) ≤ θs.

The cost in (15), upon simpliﬁcation, can be written

as:

−βa

ρa

seρa

θs + e

− θse + ξ + Jξ 1 + seρa

(17)

Since Jξ(s) ≤ θ for all s ∈ (0, 1], the expression in (17) is strictly less that θs for large enough a < ∞. Hence, according to (16), it is not optimal to not place any relay and the Bellman equation (16) can be rewritten as:

a
βe−βz s(eρz −1)dz+e−βa s(eρa −1)+ξ+Jξ

(18)

a≥0

9

4.2.2 Case II (β ≤ ρ)

Here the cost in (15) is ∞ if we do not place a relay

(i.e., if a = ∞). Let us consider a policy π1 where we

place the next relay at a ﬁxed distance 0 < a < ∞ from

the current relay, irrespective of the current state. If the

residual length of the line is z at any state s, we will

place

less

than

z a

additional

relays,

and

for

each

relay

a

cost less than (ξ + (eρa − 1)) is incurred (since s ≤ 1).

At the last step when we place the sink, a cost less than

(eρa − 1) is incurred. Thus, the value function of this

policy is upper bounded by:

∞ βe−βz z (ξ + (eρa − 1))dz + (eρa − 1)

0

a

= 1 (ξ + (eρa − 1)) + (eρa − 1)

Hence,

Jξ (s)

≤

1 βa

(ξ

(eρa

(eρa

<

∞.

Thus,

by the same argument as in the case β > ρ, the minimizer

in the Bellman equation lies in [0, ∞), i.e., the optimal

placement distance lies in [0, ∞). Hence, (16) can be

rewritten as:

Jξ(s) = inf

(20)

4.3 Upper Bound on the Optimal Value Function

Proposition 1: If β > ρ, then Jξ(s) < θs for all s ∈ (0, 1].

Proof: We know that Jξ(s) ≤ θs ≤ θ. Now, let us

consider the Bellman equation (18). It is easy to see that (−θseρa + ξ + Jξ( 1+sesρeaρa )) is strictly negative for sufﬁciently large a. Hence, the R.H.S of (18) is strictly

less than θs.

Corollary 1: For β > ρ, lims→0 Jξ(s) → 0 for any ξ > 0.

Proof: Follows from Proposition 1.

Proposition 2: If β > 0 and ρ > 0 and 0 < a < ∞, then

Jξ (s)

1 βa

(ξ

(eρa

for

Proof: Follows from (19), since the analysis is valid

even for β > ρ.

4.4 Convergence of the Value Iteration The value iteration for our MDP is given by:

J (k+1)(s) = inf

βe−βz s(eρz − 1)dz + e−βa s(eρa − 1)
0

(k)

seρa

+ξ + Jξ 1 + seρa

(21)

Here Jξ(k)(s) is the k-th iterate of the value iteration. Let us start with Jξ(0)(s) := 0 for all s ∈ (0, 1]. We set Jξ(k)(EOL) = 0 for all k ≥ 0. Jξ(k)(s) is the optimal value function for a problem with the same single-stage cost
and the same transition structure, but with the horizon
length being k (instead of inﬁnite horizon as in our
original problem) and 0 terminal cost. Here, by horizon
length k, we mean that there are k number of relays
available for deployment.

Let Γk(s) be the set of minimizers of (21) at the k-th iteration at state s, if the inﬁmum is achieved at some a < ∞. Let Γ∞(s) := {a ∈ A : a be an accumulation point of some sequence {ak} where each ak ∈ Γk(s)}. Let Γ∗(s) be the set of minimizers in (20). In Appendix G, we show that Γk(s) for each k ≥ 1, Γ∞(s) and Γ∗(s) are nonempty.
Theorem 7: The value iteration given by (21) has the following properties:
(i) Jξ(k)(s) → Jξ(s) for all s ∈ (0, 1], i.e., the value iteration converges to the optimal value function.
(ii) Γ∞(s) ⊂ Γ∗(s). (iii) There is a stationary optimal policy f ∞ =
{f, f, f, · · · } where f : (0, 1] → A and f (s) ∈ Γ∞(s) for all s ∈ (0, 1].
Proof: The proof is given in Appendix G. It uses some results from [29], which have been discussed ﬁrst. Next, we provide a general theorem (Theorem 11) on the convergence of value iteration, which has been used to prove Theorem 7.
Remark: Since the action space is noncompact, it is not obvious from standard results whether the optimal policy exists. However, we are able to show that in our problem, for each state s ∈ (0, 1], the optimal action will lie in a compact set of the from [0, a(s)], where a(s) is continuous in s, and a(s) could possibly go to ∞ as s → 0. The results of [29] allow us to work with the scenario where for each state s, it is sufﬁcient to focus only on a compact action space [0, a(s)].
4.5 Properties of the Value Function Jξ(s)
Proposition 3: Jξ(s) is increasing and concave over s ∈ (0, 1].
Proposition 4: Jξ(s) is increasing and concave in ξ for all s ∈ (0, 1].
Proposition 5: Jξ(s) is continuous in s over (0, 1] and continuous in ξ over (0, ∞). See Appendix H for the proofs of these propositions.

4.6 A Useful Normalization

Note that, βL is exponentially distributed with mean 1.

Deﬁning

Λ :=

ρ β

and

z˜k

:= βyk,

k

= 1, 2, · · ·

, (N + 1),

we

can rewrite (9) as follows:

inf Eπ
π∈Π

eΛz˜1 +

eΛz˜k − eΛz˜k−1

+ ξN

1 + eΛz˜1 + · · · + eΛz˜k−1

k=2

(22)

Note that, Λ plays the same role as λ played in the

known

L

case

(see

Section

3.2).

Since

1 β

is

the

mean

length of the line, Λ can be considered as a measure

of attenuation in the network. We can think of the new

problem (22) in the same way as (9), but with the length

of the line being exponentially distributed with mean 1

(β = 1) and the path-loss exponent being changed to

ρ

=Λ=

ρ β

.

The

relay

locations

are

also

normalized

(z˜k = βyk). One can solve the new problem (22) and

obtain the optimal policy. Then the solution to (9) can

be obtained by multiplying each control distance (from

the

optimal

policy

of

(22))

with

the

constant

1 β

.

Hence,

it sufﬁces to work with β = 1.

5 A NUMERICAL STUDY OF AS-YOU-GO DE-

PLOYMENT

Let us recall that the state of the system after placing the

k-th relay is given by sk =

eΛz˜k
k

. The action is the

i=0 eΛz˜i

normalized distance of the next relay to be placed from

the current location. The single stage cost function for

our total cost minimization problem is given by (14).

In our numerical work, we discretized the state space

(0, 1] into 100 steps as {0.01, 0.02, · · · , 0.99, 1}, and dis-

cretized the action space into steps of size 0.001, i.e., the

action space becomes {0, 0.001, 0.002, · · · }.

5.1 Structure of the Optimal Policy

We performed numerical experiments to study the struc-

ture of the optimal policy obtained through value it-

eration for β

=

1 and some values of Λ

:=

ρ β

.

The

value iteration in these experiments converged and we

obtained a stationary optimal policy, though Theorem 7

does not guarantee the uniqueness of the stationary

optimal policy.

Figure 5 shows that the normalized optimal placement

distance a∗ is decreasing with the state s ∈ (0, 1]. This

can be understood as follows. The state s (at a placement

point) is small only if a sufﬁciently large number of

relays have already been placed.6 Hence, if several relays have already been placed and ki=0 eΛz˜i is sufﬁciently large compared to eΛz˜k (i.e., sk is small), the (k + 1)-st

relay will be able to receive sufﬁcient amount of power from the previous nodes, and hence does not need to be placed close to the k-th relay. A value of sk close to 1 indicates that there is a large gap between relay k and relay k − 1, the power received at the next relay from the previous relays is small and hence the next relay must be placed closer to the previous one.
On the other hand, a∗ is increasing with ξ (see Figure 6). Recall that ξ is the price of placing a relay. This ﬁgure conﬁrms the intuition that if the relay price is high, then the relays should be placed less frequently.
Figure 7 shows that a∗ is decreasing with Λ, for ﬁxed values of ξ and s. This happens because increased attenuation will require frequent placement of the relays.

5.2 Relay Placement Patterns
The policy that we use corresponds to a line having exponentially distributed length with mean 1, but it is applied to the scenario where the actual realization of the (normalised) length (see Section 4.6) of the line is 10.
Tables 1, 3, and 5 illustrate some examples of as-yougo placement of relay nodes along a line of normalised length 10, using various values of Λ and ξ. Tables 2, 4, and 6 illustrate the corresponding evolution of state as the relays are placed in the examples in Tables 1, 3 and 5. If the line actually ends at some point before (normalised) distance 10, the process would end there with the corresponding placement of relays (as can be obtained from Tables 1, 3, and 5) before the sink being placed at the end-point. Thus, for example, reading from Table 3 for ξ = 0.1 and Λ = 5, if the actual normalised length of the line is 0.99, then one relay will be placed at 0 (the source itself), followed by 15 relays at normalised distances 0.005, 0.051, 0.122, 0.193, 0.264, · · · , 0.974 from the source, and ﬁnally the sink is placed at a normalised distance 0.99, the end of the line.
We observe that as Λ increases, more relays need to be placed since the optimal control decreases with Λ for each s (see Figure 7). On the other hand, the number of relays decreases with increasing ξ (the relay cost); this is in conﬁrmation of the observations from Figure 6.
Note that, initially one or more relays are placed at or near the source if a∗(s = 1) is 0 or small. But, after some relays have been placed, the relays are placed equally spaced apart. We see that this happens because, after a few relays have been placed, the state, s, does not change, hence, resulting in the relays being subsequently placed equally spaced apart. This phenomenon is evident in Table 2, Table 4, Table 6, and Figure 8. The state s will remain unchanged after a relay placement if s = 0.01(s1e+Λas∗eΛ(sa)∗(s)) × 0.01, since we have discretized the state space. After some relays are placed, the state becomes equal to a ﬁxed point s of the function
0.01(s1e+Λas∗eΛ(sa)∗(s)) × 0.01. Note that the deployment starts from s0 := 1, but for any value of s0 (even with s0 smaller than s ), we numerically observe the same phenomenon. Hence, s is an absorbing state.
5.3 Numerical Examples for Practical Deployment
In order to provide a more concrete illustration we adopt a path loss parameter from [24]. Figure 4 of [24] shows that the attenuation in the received signal power in a

dense urban environment is roughly 50 dB when we

move from 50 m distance to 300 m distance away from

the transmitter. This yields a value of ρ to be 0.04 per

meter for the exponential path-loss (see the discussion in

Section 6.1 on the motivation for choosing the exponen-

tial path-loss model in the light of the results from [24]).

Then,

corresponds to Λ = 20. For Λ = 20, normalised relay

locations and state evolution {sk}k≥1 are available in

Tables 3-6, and, for Λ = 8, normalised relay locations

and state evolution {sk}k≥1 are available in Tables 3-

4. Note that, under ρ = 0.04 per meter and Λ = 20,

one unit normalised distance in the tables correspond to

500 m distance in the dense urban environment (due to

the normalization as in Section 4.6).

For the sake of illustration, let us consider the sample

deployment for ξ = 10, Λ = 20 (Table 5). In this case,

the ﬁrst relay will be placed at a distance 0.099 × 500 =

49.5 m from the source, the second relay will be placed

at a distance 0.205 × 500 = 102.5 m from the source, etc.

Also, if we choose ξ such that few relays will be placed

on a typical line whose length is several hundreds of

meters, then the relays will be placed almost uniformly

on the line. But, for small ξ, more relays will be placed

and some of them will be clustered near the source (see

the deployment for Λ = 8 and ξ = 0.1 in Table 3).

5.4 Comparison with Optimal Ofﬂine Deployment
Since there is no prior work in the literature with which we can make a fair comparison of our as-you-go deployment policy for the full-duplex wireless multi-relay network, we compare the performance of our policy with optimal ofﬂine deployment. Thus, the numerical experiments reported in Table 7 are a result of asking the following question: how does the cost of as-yougo deployment over a line of exponentially distributed length compare with the cost of placing the same number

ξ = 0.001, we will place two relays at the source
(Table 1). After placing the ﬁrst relay, the next state will become s = 0.5, and a∗(s = 0.5) = 0. The state
after placing the second relay becomes s = 0.34, for which a∗(s = 0.34) = 8.41 (see the placement
in Table 1). Now, the line having an exponentially

As a result, the mean number of relays will be 2.0002. In case only 2 relays are placed by the sequential deployment policy and we seek to place 2 relays optimally for the same length of the line (with the length known), the optimal locations for both relays are close to the source location if the

of relays optimally over the line, once the length of the

line has been revealed?

For several combinations of Λ and ξ, we generated

10000 random numbers independently from an expo-

nential distribution with parameter β = 1. Each of

these numbers was considered as a possible realiza-

tion of the length of the line. Then we computed the

placement of the relay nodes for each realization by

optimal sequential placement policy, which gave us

H = g01,1 +

Nk=+21 g0,k(gg00,k,k−−11−gkl=0−,0k1)g 1 , a quantity that we 0,l

use to evaluate the quality of the relay placement. The

signiﬁcance of H can be recalled from (6) where we found that the rate C(1 + PTH/σ2 ) can be achieved if total power PT is available to distribute among the source and

the relays; i.e., H can be interpreted as the net effective

attenuation after power has been allocated optimally

over the nodes. Also, for each realization, we computed

H for optimal relay placement, assuming that the length

of the line is known before deployment and that the

length of the line is small (i.e., if the attenuation λ

is small, recall the deﬁnition of λ from Section 3.2).

If the line is long (which has a very small proba-

bility), the optimal placement will be signiﬁcantly

different from the sequential placement. Altogether,

the difference (from (23)) will be small.

(ii) For Λ = 0.01 and ξ = 0.1, a∗(1) is so large that with

high probability the line will end in a distance less

than a∗(1) and no relay will be placed.

(iii) From (6) we know that for a given placement of

relays on a line of given length L, the optimal power

than Ho(kpt)imal, we have Hs(ekq)uential ≤ 53 Ho(kpt)imal for all k ≥ 1 (i.e., for all realizations of L in the

simulation). Now, by the monotonicity of log2(·):

number of relays available is the same as the number of
relays used by the corresponding sequential placement
policy. For a given combination of Λ and ξ, for the k-th
realization of the length of the line, let us denote the two H values by Hs(ekq)uential and Ho(pkt)imal. Then the percentage difference for the k-th realization is:

This calculation implies that, for the large number of

cases reported in Table 7, by using the approximation in (10) and by using the corresponding optimal policy for as-you-go deployment, we lose at most 0.3685 bits per channel use, compared to the case when the realization of the exponentially distributed source to sink distance is known apriori and when we use the same number of relays as used in the asyou-go deployment case. Note that, the statement of this claim holds with high probability since the maximum difference is taken over 10000 sample deployments. Hence, it is reasonable to solve (10) instead of (11) which is intractable.
6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Exponential Path-Loss Model
Exponential path-loss model has been used before in the context of relay placement (see [16], [22]) and in the context of cellular networks (see [26, Section 2.3]). Analytical and experimental support for the exponential path-loss model have been provided by Franceschetti et al. ([24]). Franceschetti et al. used a random scattering model (applicable to an urban environment, or a forest environment) to show that the path-loss in such an environment is the product of an exponential function and a power function of the distance (see [24, Equation (14)]). Figure 4 of their paper, which is obtained from measurements made in an urban environment, shows that path-loss (in dB) varies linearly with distance beyond a distance of 40 − 50 meters, which implies exponential path-loss for longer distance. These distances are practical for urban scenarios where the network is deployed over several hundreds of meters or several kilometers.
Exponential path-loss was also proposed by Marano and Franceschetti for urban environment, and validated by theory and experiment (see [30, Figure 10]).7
6.2 Incorporating Shadowing and Fading
Shadowing (which is typically viewed as being static once a link is deployed) and time varying fading, can be incorporated in our setting by providing a fademargin in the power at each transmitter. Thus, when expressed in dBm, the actual transmit power for any transmitter-receiver pair is the fade-margin plus the power used in the information theoretic capacity formulas; this fade-margin does not depend on the distance between the transmitter-receiver pair. Note that, this approach, though very conservative in nature, can remove the complexity in analysis arising out of fading in the network. Also note that, if the actual power gain between two nodes r distance apart is c0e−ρr with c0 > 0, then c0 can be absorbed in the fade margin.
7. Marano and Franceschetti ([30]) modeled a city as a random lattice, and the distance from the transmitter to the receiver is measured along the edges of the lattice instead of the Euclidean distance. Hence, this result renders the analysis in our paper valid even for deployment along the streets of a city with turns; deployment algorithm in that case will only consider the distances along the streets and not on the actual Euclidean distances.

6.3 Full-Duplex Decode-and-Forward Relaying
Full-duplex radios might become a reality soon; see [11], [12], [13], [14] for recent efforts to realize them. Decodeand-forward relaying requires symbol-level synchronous operation across all nodes in the network. The requirement of globally coherent transmission and reception seems to be restrictive at the moment, but this problem will be solved with the advent of better clocks (with less drift) and efﬁcient clock synchronization algorithms. Any research on impromptu deployment assuming imperfect synchronization, or half-duplex communication, or no interference cancellation, can use this paper as a benchmark for performance analysis.
6.4 Insights on Power-Law Path-Loss
In [1], we studied the problem of single-relay placement under a per-node power constraint at the source and the relay, for both exponential and power-law pathloss models. The variation of optimal relay location, as the amount of attenuation in the network varies, follow slightly different (but mostly similar) trends (see Figures 2 and 3 of [1]) because of the fact that powerlaw model allows unbounded power gain (unlike the exponential model) when the distance r tends to 0 (limr→0 r−η = ∞). The ﬁndings are even more similar when we bound the power gain from above by some constant value in case of the power-law model (power gain is min{r−η, b−η} for some b > 0); see the similarity between Figures 2 and 4 in [1]. The results on the ﬁxed node power case provide the insight that when the power gain is r−η or min{r−η, b−η}; under the sum power constraint, the variation of the relay locations as a function of attenuation will follow a pattern similar to that in case of exponential path-loss.
7 CONCLUSION
Motivated by the problem of as-you-go deployment of wireless relay networks, we ﬁrst studied the problem of placing relay nodes along a line, in order to connect a sink at the end of the line to a source at the start of the line, so as to maximize the end-to-end achievable data rate. For the multi-relay channel with exponential path-loss and sum power constraint, we derived an expression for the achievable rate in terms of the power gains among all possible node pairs, and formulated an optimization problem in order to maximize the endto-end data rate. Numerical work for the ﬁxed sourcesink distance suggests that at low attenuation the relays are mostly clustered close to the source in order to be able to cooperate among themselves, whereas at high attenuation they are uniformly placed and work as repeaters. Next, the deploy-as-you-go sequential placement problem was addressed; a sequential relay placement problem along a line having unknown random length was formulated as an MDP, the value function was characterized analytically, and the policy structure was investigated numerically. We found numerically that

14

at the initial stage of the deployment process the inter-
relay distances are smaller, and, as deployment pro-
gresses, the inter-relay distances increase gradually, and
ﬁnally the relays start being placed at regular intervals.
Our results are based on information theoretic achiev-
able rate results. In order to utilize currently commer-
cially available wireless devices, we have also been
exploring non-information theoretic, packet forwarding
models for optimal relay placement, with the aim of ob-
taining placement algorithms that can be easily reduced
to practice (see [7] for reference). The study of as-you-
go deployment under the information theoretic model
and under the packet forwarding model provides two
complementary approaches for two different conditions
in the physical layer and the MAC layer, and provides
a more comprehensive development of the problem.

APPENDIX A A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE CODING SCHEME OF [10]
Transmissions take place via block codes of T symbols each. The transmission blocks at the source and the N relays are synchronized. The coding and decoding scheme is such that a message generated at the source at the beginning of block b, b ≥ 1, is decoded by the sink at the end of block b + N , i.e., N + 1 block durations after the message was generated (with probability tending to 1, as T → ∞). Thus, at the end of B blocks, B ≥ N + 1, the sink is able to decode B − N messages. It follows, by taking B → ∞, that, if the code rate is R bits per symbol, then an information rate of R bits per symbol can be achieved from the source to the sink.
As mentioned earlier, we index the source by 0, the relays by k, 1 ≤ k ≤ N , and the sink by N + 1. There are (N +1)2 independent Gaussian random codebooks, each containing 2T R codes, each code being of length T ; these codebooks are available to all nodes. At the beginning of block b, the source generates a new message wb, and, at this stage, we assume that each node k, 1 ≤ k ≤ N +1, has a reliable estimate of all the messages wb−j, j ≥ k. In block b, the source uses a new codebook to encode wb. In addition, relay k, 1 ≤ k ≤ N, and all of its previous transmitters (indexed 0 ≤ j ≤ k − 1), use another codebook to encode wb−k (or their estimate of it). Thus, if the relays 1, 2, · · · , k have a perfect estimate of wb−k at the beginning of block b, they will transmit the same codeword for wb−k. Therefore, in block b, the source and relays 1, 2, · · · , k coherently transmit the codeword for wb−k. In this manner, in block b, transmitter k, 0 ≤ k ≤ N, generates N + 1 − k codewords, corresponding to wb−k, wb−k−1, · · · , wb−N , which are transmitted with powers Pk,k+1, Pk,k+2, · · · , Pk,N+1. In block b, node k, 1 ≤ k ≤ N +1, receives a superposition of transmissions from all other nodes. Assuming that node k knows all the powers, and all the channel gains, and recalling that it has a reliable estimate of all the messages wb−j, j ≥ k, it can subtract the interference from transmitters k + 1, k + 2, · · · , N . At the end of block b, after subtracting the signals it knows, node k is left with the k received signals from nodes 0, 1, · · · , (k − 1) (received in blocks b, b − 1, · · · , b − k + 1), which all carry an encoding of the message wb−k+1. These k signals are then jointly used to decode wb−k+1, using joint typicality decoding. The codebooks are cycled through in a manner so that in any block all nodes encoding a message (or their estimate of it) use the same codebook, but different (thus, independent) codebooks are used for different messages. Under this encoding and decoding scheme, any rate strictly less than R displayed in (2) is achievable.
APPENDIX B PROOF OF THEOREM 1
We want to maximize R given in (2) subject to the total power constraint, assuming ﬁxed relay locations.

Let

Pi,j)2), i.e., the

k-th term in the argument of min{· · · } in (2). By

the monotonicity of C(·), it is sufﬁcient to consider

kj=1(

j−1 i=0

hi,k

Pi,j)2. Now since the channel gains are

multiplicative, we have:

k j−1
( hi,k

k
Pi,j )2 = g0,k

j−1 Pi,j 2

j=1 i=0

j=1 i=0 h0,i

Thus our optimization problem becomes:

γj ≤ PT and Pi,j = γj ∀ 1 ≤ j ≤ (N + 1) (24)

j=1

i=0

Let us ﬁx γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1 such that their sum is equal

to PT . We observe that Pi,N+1 for i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N }

appear in the objective fu√nction only once: for k = N + 1

through the term (

N i=0

Phi,N+1 )2. Since we have ﬁxed

0,i

γN+1, we need to maximize this term over Pi,N+1, i ∈

{0, 1, · · · , N }. So we have the following optimization

problem:

N Pi,N +1

N

max

s.t

Pi,N+1 = γN+1

(25)

i=0 h0,i

i=0

By Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, the objective function
in this optimization problem is upper bounded by (using the fact that g0,i = h20,i ∀i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N }):

N

N1

( Pi,N+1)(

)=

The upp√er bound is achieved if there exists some c > 0

such that

Pi,N +1

∀i

∈

{0, 1, · · ·

, N }.

So

we

have:

h0,i

c2 Pi,N+1 = g0,i ∀i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N }

Since

N i=0

Pi,N

we

obtain

Thus, Pi,N+1 =

l=0 g0,l

Here we have used the fact that h0,0 = 1. Now

{Pi,N : i = √0, 1, · · · , (N − 1)} appear only through the

sum

N −1 i=0

hPi,N , and it appears twice: for k = N and

0,i

k = N + 1. We need to maximize this sum subject to

the constraint

N −1 i=0

Pi,N

=

γN .

This

optimization

can

be solved in a similar way as before. Thus by repeatedly

using this argument and solving optimization problems

similar in nature to (25), we obtain:

1
Pi,j = j−g01,i 1 γj ∀0 ≤ i < j ≤ (N + 1) (26)
l=0 g0,l

Substituting for Pi,j, 0 ≤ i < j ≤ (N + 1) in (24), we obtain the following optimization problem:

(27)

j=1

Let us deﬁne bk := g0,k and aj := ij=−01 g01,i . Observe that bk is decreasing and ak is increasing with k. Let us
deﬁne:

k

s˜k(γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1) := bk aj γj

(28)

j=1

With this notation, our optimization problem becomes:

N +1

max min s˜k(γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1) s.t.

γj ≤ PT

(29)

1≤k≤N +1

j=1

Claim 1: Under optimal allocation of γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1 for the optimization problem (29), s˜1 = s˜2 = · · · = s˜N+1.

Proof: (29) can be rewritten as:

max ζ

s.t

ζ ≤ bk aj γj ∀ k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1},

j=1

N +1

γj ≤ PT , γj ≥ 0 ∀ 1 ≤ j ≤ N + 1

(30)

j=1

The dual of this linear program is given by:

min PT θ

N +1

s.t

µk = 1, θ ≥ 0,

k=1

N +1

al bkµk + νl = θ ∀ l ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1},

k=l

µl ≥ 0, νl ≥ 0 ∀ l ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1}

(31)

Now, let us consider a primal feasible solution ({γj∗}1≤j≤N+1, ζ∗) which satisﬁes:

k
bk aj γj∗ = ζ∗ ∀ k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1},
j=1

N +1

γj∗ = PT

(32)

j=1

Thus we have, b1a1γ1∗ = ζ∗, i.e., γ1∗ = bζa∗ . Again, 11
b2(a1γ1∗ + a2γ2∗) = ζ∗, which implies bb12 ζ∗ + b2a2γ2∗ = ζ∗.

Thus

we

obtain

γ2∗

=

ζa∗ ( b1

−

1 b

).

In

general,

we

can

22

1

write:

∗ ζ∗ γk =
ak

1

1

−

bk bk−1

∀k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1}

with b10 := 0. Now, since Nk=+11 γk∗ = PT , we obtain:

17

ζ∗ = γj∗ =

PT Nk=+11 a1k ( b1k − bk1−1 )

a1j b1j − bj1−1

PT , j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1}

Nk=+11 a1k ( b1k − bk1−1 )

(33)

It should be noted that since bk is nonincreasing in k, the
primal variables above are nonnegative and satisﬁes fea-
sibility conditions. Again, let us consider a dual feasible solution ({µ∗j , νj∗}1≤j≤N+1, θ∗) which satisﬁes:

N +1
µ∗k = 1, νl∗ = 0 ∀ l ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1}
k=1

N +1

al

bkµ∗k + νl∗ = θ∗ ∀ l ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1}

(34)

k=l

Solving these equations, we obtain:

θ∗ = µ∗j =

1

N +1 1 k=1 bk
b1j ( a1j

a1k − ak1+1 − aj1+1 )

N +1 1 k=1 bk

a1k − ak1+1

, j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N + 1} (35)

where aN1+2 := 0. Since ak is increasing in k, all dual variables are feasible. It is easy to check that
ζ∗ = PT θ∗, which means that there is no duality

gap. Since the primal is a linear program, the solution

(

γ

∗ 1

,

γ2∗

,

·

·

·

, γN∗ +1, ζ∗)

is

primal

optimal.

Thus

we

have

established the claim, since the primal optimal solution

satisﬁes it.

So let us obtain γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1 for which s˜1 =

s˜2 = · · · = s˜N+1. Putting s˜k = s˜k−1, we obtain

bk

k j=1

aj

γj

=

bk−1

k−1 j=1

aj

γj

.

Thus,

we

obtain,

γk

=

(bk−1−bk) 1

bk

ak

k−1 j=1

aj

γj

Let dk := (bk−b1k−bk) a1k . Hence, γk = dk

k−1 j=1

aj

γj

.

From this recursive equation, we have γ2 = d2a1γ1,

γ3 = d3(a1γ1 + a2γ2) = d3a1(1 + a2d2)γ1, and, in general

for k ≥ 3,

γk = dka1Πkj=−21(1 + aj dj )γ1

(36)

Using the fact that γ1 +γ2 +· · ·+γN+1 = PT , we obtain:

PT

γ1 =

N +1

k−1

(37)

1 + d2a1 + k=3 dka1Πj=2 (1 + aj dj )

Thus if s˜1 = s˜2 = · · · = s˜N+1, there is a unique allocation γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1. So this must be the one maximizing R. Hence, optimum γ1 is obtained by (37). Then, substituting the values of {ak : k = 0, 1, · · · , N } and dk : k = 1, 2, · · · , N + 1 in (36) and (37), we obtain the values of γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1 as shown in Theorem 1.
Now under these optimal values of γ1, γ2, · · · , γN+1, all terms in the argument of min{· · · } in (2) are equal. So we can consider the ﬁrst term alone. Thus we obtain the expression for R optimized over power allocation among all the nodes for ﬁxed relay locations as : RPopTt(y1, y2, · · · , yN ) = C g0,1σP20,1 = C g0σ,12γ1 .

Substituting the expression for γ1 from (5), we obtain the achievable rate formula (6).

APPENDIX C PROOF OF THEOREM 2

Here we want to place the relay node at a distance r1

from the source to minimize

+ 1
g0,1

g0,1 −g0,2 g0,2 (1+g0,1 )

(see

Equation (6)). Hence, our optimization problem becomes

: e−ρr1 − e−ρL

min eρr1 +

r1 ∈[0,L]

e−ρL(1 + e−ρr1 )

Writing z1 = eρr1 , the problem becomes :

min
z1 ∈[1,eρL ]

eρL + 1 z1 − 1 + z1 + 1

This is a convex optimization problem. Equating the

derivative of the objective function to zero, we obtain 1 − (ezρ1L√++1)12 = 0. Thus the derivative becomes zero at z1 = 1 + eρL − 1 > 0. Hence, the objective func-

tion is decreasing in z1 for z1 ≤ z1 and increasing in z1 ≥ z1. So the minimizer is z1∗ = max{z1, 1}. So the

optimum distance of the relay node from√the source is y1∗ = r1∗ = max{0, r1}, where r1 = ρ1 log( 1 + eρL − 1). Hence, yL1∗ = max{ λ1 log √eλ + 1 − 1 , 0}. Now r1 ≥ 0

if and only if λ ≥ log 3. Hence, y1∗ = 0 for λ ≤ log 3 and

y1∗ = 1 log

√ eλ + 1 − 1

L
for λ ≥ log 3.

Lλ

For λ ≤ log 3, the relay is placed at the source. Then

g0,1

=

and

g0,2

=

g1,2

=

e−λ.

Then

P0,1

=

γ1

=

2PT eλ +1

(by

Theorem 1) and R∗ = C (eλ2+P1T)σ2 . Also γ2 = eeλλ−+11 PT .

Hence, P0,2 = P1,2 = eeλλ−+11 P2T .

for λ ≥ log 3, the relay is placed at r1. Substituting the

value

of

r1

into

Equation

(4√),

we

obtain

P0,1

=

γ1

=

PT 2

,

P0,2 = √e1λ+1 P2T , P1,2 = √eλe+λ+1−1 1 P2T . So in this case

R∗ = C g0,1σP20,1 . Since P0,1 = P2T , we have R∗ =

C √eλ1+1−1 2PσT2 .

APPENDIX D PROOF OF THEOREM 3

For the N -relay problem, let the minimizer in (8) be

z1∗, z2∗, · · ·

and

let

yk∗

Clearly,

there

exists

i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , N } such that yi∗+1 > yi∗. Let us insert a

new relay at a distance y from the source such that

yi∗ < y < yi∗+1. Now we ﬁnd that we can easily reach (38)

(see next page) just by simple comparison. For example,

First i terms in the summations of L.H.S (left hand side) and R.H.S (right hand side) of (38) are identical. Also sum of the remaining terms in L.H.S is smaller than that of the R.H.S since there is an additional eρy in the denominator of each fraction for the L.H.S. Hence, we can justify (38). Now R.H.S is precisely the optimum objective function for the N -relay placement problem (see (8)). On the other hand, L.H.S is a particular value of the objective in (8), for (N + 1)-relay placement problem. This clearly implies that by adding one additional relay we can strictly improve from R∗ of the N relay channel. Hence, R∗(N + 1) > R∗(N ).

APPENDIX E PROOF OF THEOREM 4

Consider the optimization problem as shown in (8).
Let us consider λ1, λ2, with λ1 < λ2, the respective minimizers being (z1∗, · · · , zN∗ ) and (z1, · · · , zN ). Clearly,

Hence, G(N, λ) is increasing in λ for ﬁxed N .

APPENDIX F PROOF OF THEOREM 5

APPENDIX G PROOF OF THEOREM 7
As we have seen in Section 4, our problem is a negative dynamic programming problem (i.e., the N case of [29], where single-stage rewards are non-positive). It is to be noted that Schäl [29] discusses two other kind of problems as well: the P case (single-stage rewards are positive) and the D case (the reward at stage k is discounted by a factor αk, where 0 < α < 1). In this appendix, we ﬁrst state a general-purpose theorem for the value iteration (Theorem 11), prove it by some results of [29], and then we use this theorem to prove Theorem 7.

G.1 A General Result (Derived from [29])
Consider an inﬁnite horizon total cost MDP whose state space S is an interval in R and the action space A is [0, ∞). Let the set of possible actions at state s be denoted by A(s). Let the single-stage cost be c(s, a, w) ≥ 0 where s, a and w are the state, the action and the disturbance, respectively. Let us denote the optimal expected costto-go at state s by V ∗(s). Let the state of the system evolve as sk+1 = h(sk, ak, wk), where sk, ak and wk are the state, the action and the disturbance at the kth instant, respectively. Let s∗ ∈ S be an absorbing state with c(s∗, a, w) = 0 for all a, w. Let us consider the value iteration for all s ∈ S, with V (0)(·) = 0:

V (k+1)(s) = inf Ew c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w)) , s = s∗
a∈[0,∞)

V (k+1)(s∗) = 0

(45)

We provide some results and concepts from [29], which will be used later to prove Theorem 7.
Theorem 8: [Theorem 4.2 ([29])] V (k)(s) → V (∞)(s) for all s ∈ S, i.e., the value iteration (45) converges.
Let us recall that Γk(s) is the set of minimizers of (45) at the k-th iteration at state s, if the inﬁmum is achieved at some a < ∞. Γ∞(s) := {a ∈ A : a is an accumulation point of some sequence {ak} where each ak ∈ Γk(s)}. Γ∗(s) is the set of minimizers in the Bellman Equation.
Let C(A) be the set of nonempty compact subsets of A. The Hausdorff metric d on C(A) is deﬁned as follows:

d(C1, C2) = max{ sup ρ(c, C2), sup ρ(c, C1)}

c∈C1

c∈C2

where ρ(c, C) is the minimum distance between the point c and the compact set C.
Proposition 6: [Proposition 9.1([29])] (C(A), d) is a separable metric space.
A mapping φ : S → C(A) is called measurable if it is measurable with respect to the Borel σ-algebra of (C(A), d).
Fˆ(S × A) is the set of all measurable functions v : S × A → R which are bounded below and where every such v(·) is the limit of a non-decreasing sequence of measurable, bounded functions vk : S × A → R.
We will next present a condition followed by a theorem. The condition, if satisﬁed, implies the convergence of value iteration (45) to the optimal value function (according to the theorem).
Condition 1: [Derived from Condition A in [29]]

(i) A(s) ∈ C(A) for all s ∈ S and A : S → C(A) is
measurable. (ii) Ew(c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w))) is in Fˆ(S × A) for all
k ≥ 0.

Theorem 9: [Theorem 13.3, [29]] If c(s, a, w) ≥ 0 for all s, a, w and Condition 1 holds:

(i) V (∞)(s) = V ∗(s), s ∈ S. (ii) Γ∞(s) ⊂ Γ∗(s). (iii) There is a stationary optimal policy f ∞ where f :
S → A and f (s) ∈ Γ∞(s) for all s ∈ S.

The next condition and theorem deal with the situation where the action space is noncompact.
Condition 2: [Condition B ([29])] There is a measurable mapping A : S → C(A) such that:

(i) A(s) ⊂ A(s) for all s ∈ S.

(ii) infa∈A(s)−A(s) Ew c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w))

>

infa∈A(s) Ew c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w)) for all k ≥ 0.

This condition requires that for each state s, there is a compact set A(s) of actions such that no optimizer of the value iteration lies outside the set A(s) at any stage k ≥ 0.
Theorem 10: [Theorem 17.1, [29]] If Condition 2 is satisﬁed and if the three statements in Theorem 9 are valid for the modiﬁed problem having admissible set of actions

20

A(s) for each state s ∈ S, then those statements are valid for the original problem as well.
Now we will provide an important theorem which will be used to prove Theorem 7.
Theorem 11: If the value iteration (45) satisﬁes the following conditions:
(a) For each k, Ew c(s, a, w)+V (k)(h(s, a, w)) is jointly
continuous in a and s for s = s∗. (b) The inﬁmum in (45) is achieved in [0, ∞) for all s =
s∗. (c) For each s ∈ S, there exists a(s) < ∞ such that a(s)
is continuous in s for s = s∗, and no minimizer of (45) lies in (a(s), ∞) for each k ≥ 0.
Then the following hold: (i) The value iteration converges, i.e., V (k)(s) →
V (∞)(s) for all s = s∗. (ii) V (∞)(s) = V ∗(s) for all s = s∗. (iii) Γ∞(s) ⊂ Γ∗(s) for all s = s∗. (iv) There is a stationary optimal policy f ∞ where f :
S \ {s∗} → A and f (s) ∈ Γ∞(s) ∀ s = s∗.
Proof of Theorem 11: By Theorem 8, the value iteration converges, i.e., V (k)(s) → V (∞)(s). Moreover, V (k)(s) is the optimal cost for a k-stage problem with zero terminal cost, and the cost at each stage is positive. Hence, V (k)(s) increases in k for every s ∈ S. Thus, for all s ∈ S, V (k)(s) ↑ V (∞)(s).
Now, Condition 2 and Theorem 10 say that if no optimizer of the value iteration in each stage k lies outside a compact subset A(s) of A(s) ⊂ A, then we can deal with the modiﬁed problem having a new action space A(s). If the value iteration converges to the optimal value in this modiﬁed problem, then it will converge to the optimal value in the original problem as well, provided that the mapping A : S → C(A) is measurable. Let us choose A(s) := [0, a(s)], where a(s) satisﬁes hypothesis (c) of Theorem 11. Since a(s) is continuous at s = s∗, for any
> 0 we can ﬁnd a δs, > 0 such that |a(s) − a(s )| < whenever |s − s | < δs, , s = s∗, s = s∗. Now, when |a(s)−a(s )| < , we have d([0, a(s)], [0, a(s )]) < . Hence, the mapping A : S → C(A) is continuous at all s = s∗, and thereby measurable in this case. Hence, the value iteration (45) satisﬁes Condition 2.
Thus, the value iteration for s = s∗ can be modiﬁed as:
V (k+1)(s) = inf Ew(c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w))) (46)
a∈[0,a(s)]
Now, Ew(c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w))) is continuous (can be discontinuous at s = s∗, since this quantity is 0 at s = s∗) on S × A (by our hypothesis). Hence, Ew(c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w))) is measurable on S × A. Also, it is bounded below by 0. Hence, it can be approximated by an increasing sequence of bounded measurable functions {vn,k}n≥1 given by vn,k(s, a) = min{Ew(c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w))), n}. Hence, Ew(c(s, a, w) + V (k)(h(s, a, w))) is in Fˆ(S × A).
Thus, Condition 1 is satisﬁed for the modiﬁed problem and therefore, by Theorem 9, the modiﬁed value iteration

in (46) converges to the optimal value function. Now, by
Theorem 10, we can argue that the value iteration (45)
converges to the optimal value function in the original problem and hence V (∞)(s) = V ∗(s) for all s ∈ S \ s∗. Also, Γ∞(s) ⊂ Γ∗(s) for all s ∈ S \ s∗ and there exists a stationary optimal policy f ∞ where f (s) ∈ Γ∞(s) for all s ∈ S \ s∗ (by Theorem 9).

G.2 Proof of Theorem 7

This proof uses the results of Theorem 11 provided in

this appendix. Remember that the state EOL is absorb-

ing and c(EOL, a, w) = 0 for all a, w. We can think of it

as state 0 so that our state space becomes [0, 1] which is

a Borel set. We will see that the state 0 plays the role of

the state s∗ as mentioned in Theorem 11.

We need to check whether the conditions (a), (b), and

(c) in Theorem 11 are satisﬁed for the value iteration (21). Of course, Jξ(0)(s) = 0 is concave, increasing in

s ∈ (0, 1]. Suppose that Jξ(k)(s) is concave, increasing in s for some k ≥ 0. Also, for any ﬁxed a ≥ 0, 1+sesρeaρa is concave and increasing in s. Thus, by the composition

rule for the composition of a concave increasing function

Jξ(k)(·)

and

a

concave

increasing

function

, seρa
1+seρa

for

any

a ≥ 0 the term Jξ(k)

seρa 1+seρa

is concave, increasing over

s ∈ (0, 1]. Hence, 0a βe−βzs(eρz − 1)dz + e−βa s(eρa −

1) + ξ + Jξ(k) 1+sesρeaρa (in (21)) is concave increasing
over s ∈ (0, 1]. Since the inﬁmization over a preserves concavity, we conclude that Jξ(k+1)(s) is concave, increasing over s ∈ (0, 1]. Hence, for each k, Jξ(k)(s) is continuous in s over (0, 1), since otherwise concavity w.r.t. s will be violated. Now, we must have Jξ(k)(1) ≤ lims↑1 Jξ(k)(s), since otherwise the concavity of Jξ(k)(s) will be violated. But since Jξ(k)(s) is increasing in s, Jξ(k)(1) ≥ lims↑1 Jξ(k)(s). Hence, Jξ(k)(1) = lims↑1 Jξ(k)(s). Thus, Jξ(k)(s) is continuous in s over (0, 1] for each k.
Hence, 0a βe−βzs(eρz − 1)dz + e−βa(s(eρa − 1) + ξ + Jξ(k)( 1+sesρeaρa )) is continuous in s, a for s = 0. Hence, condition (a) in Theorem 11 is satisﬁed.
Now, we will check condition (c) in Theorem 11.
By Theorem 8, the value iteration converges, i.e., Jξ(k)(s) → Jξ(∞)(s). Also, Jξ(∞)(s) is concave, increasing in s ∈ (0, 1] and hence continuous. Moreover, Jξ(k)(s) is the optimal cost for a k-stage problem with zero terminal cost, and the cost at each stage is positive. Hence, Jξ(k)(s) increases in k for every s ∈ (0, 1]. Thus, for all s ∈ (0, 1], Jξ(k)(s) ↑ Jξ(∞)(s).
Again, Jξ(k)(s) is the optimal cost for a k-stage problem with zero terminal cost. Hence, it is less than or equal to
the optimal cost for the inﬁnite horizon problem with the same transition law and cost structure. Hence, Jξ(k)(s) ≤ Jξ(s) for all k ≥ 1. Since Jξ(k)(s) ↑ Jξ(∞)(s), we have Jξ(∞)(s) ≤ Jξ(s).

Now, consider the following two cases:

G.2.1 β > ρ

Let us deﬁne a function ψ : (0, 1] → R by ψ(s) =

J (∞)(s)+θs

ξ
2

. By Proposition 1, Jξ(s) < θs for all s ∈ (0, 1].

Hence, Jξ(∞)(s) < ψ(s) < θs and ψ(s) is continuous

over s ∈ (0, 1]. Since β > ρ and Jξ(k)(s) ∈ [0, θ] for

any s in (0, 1], the expression θs + e−βa − θseρa +

ξ + Jξ(k) 1+sesρeaρa obtained from the R.H.S of (21) con-

verges to θs as a → ∞. A lower bound to this expression is θs + e−βa(−θseρa). With β > ρ, for each s, there exists a(s) < ∞ such that θs + e−βa(−θseρa) > ψ(s) for all a >

a(s). But θs+infa≥0 e−βa

−θseρa +ξ +Jξ(k)

seρa 1+seρa

is

equal to Jξ(k+1)(s) < ψ(s). Hence, for any s ∈ (0, 1], the minimizers for (18) always lie in the compact interval
[0, a(s)] for all k ≥ 1. Since ψ(s) is continuous in s, we
can choose a(s) as a continuous function of s on (0, 1].

G.2.2 β ≤ ρ

Fix

A,

0

<

A

<

∞.

Let

K

:=

1 βA

ξ + (eρA − 1) +(eρA−1).

Then, by Proposition 2, Jξ(s) ≤ K for all s ∈ (0, 1]. Now,

we observe that the objective function (for minimiza-

tion over a) in the R.H.S of (21) is lower bounded by 0a βe−βzs(eρz − 1)dz, which is continuous in s, a and goes to ∞ as a → ∞ for each s ∈ (0, 1]. Hence, for

each s ∈ (0, 1], there exists 0 < a(s) < ∞ such that 0a βse−βz(eρz − 1)dz > 2K for all a > a(s) and a(s) is continuous over s ∈ (0, 1]. But Jξ(k+1)(s) ≤ Jξ(s) ≤ K for all k. Hence, the minimizers in (21) always lie in

[0, a(s)] where a(s) is independent of k and continuous

over s ∈ (0, 1]. Let us set a(0) = a(1).8 Then, the chosen function a(s)

is continuous over s ∈ (0, 1] and can be discontinuous

only at s = 0. Thus, condition (c) of Theorem 11 has

been veriﬁed for the value iteration (21). Condition (b)

of Theorem 11 is obviously satisﬁed since a continuous

function over a compact set always has a minimizer.

Remark: Observe that in our value iteration (21) it is

always sufﬁcient to deal with compact action spaces, and

the objective functions to be minimized at each stage of

the value iteration are continuous in s, a. Hence, Γk(s)

is nonempty for each s ∈ (0, 1], k ≥ 0. Also, since there exists K > 0 such that Jξ(k)(s) ≤ K for all k ≥ 0, s ∈ (0, 1],
it is sufﬁcient to restrict the action space in (21) to a set

[0, a(s)] for any s ∈ (0, 1], k ≥ 0. Hence, Γk(s) ⊂ [0, a(s)]

for all s ∈ (0, 1], k ≥ 0. Now, for a ﬁxed s ∈ (0, 1], any

sequence {ak}k≥0 with ak ∈ Γk(s), in bounded. Hence,

the sequence must have a limit point. Hence, Γ∞(s) is nonempty for each s ∈ (0, 1]. Since Γ∞(s) ⊂ Γ∗(s), Γ∗(s)

is nonempty for each s ∈ (0, 1].

APPENDIX H PROOFS OF PROPOSITIONS 3, 4 AND 5
H.1 Proof of Proposition 3
Fix ξ. Consider the value iteration (21). Let us start with Jξ(0)(s) := 0 for all s ∈ (0, 1]. Clearly, Jξ(1)(s) is concave and increasing in s, since pointwise inﬁmum of linear functions is concave. Now let us assume that Jξ(k)(s) is concave and increasing in s. Then, by the composition rule, it is easy to show that Jξ(k)( 1+sesρeaρa ) is concave and increasing in s for any ﬁxed a ≥ 0. Hence, Jξ(k+1)(s) is concave and increasing, since pointwise inﬁmum of a set of concave and increasing functions is concave and increasing. By Theorem 7, Jξ(k)(s) → Jξ(s). Hence, Jξ(s) is concave and increasing in s.
H.2 Proof of Proposition 4
Consider the value iteration (21). Since Jξ(0)(s) := 0 for all s ∈ (0, 1], Jξ(1)(s) is obtained by taking inﬁmum (over a) of a linear, increasing function of ξ. Hence, Jξ(1)(s) is concave, increasing over ξ ∈ (0, ∞). If we assume that Jξ(k)(s) is concave and increasing in ξ, then Jξ(k)( 1+sesρeaρa ) is also concave and increasing in ξ for ﬁxed s and a. Thus, Jξ(k+1)(s) is also concave and increasing in ξ. Now, Jξ(k)(s) → Jξ(s) for all s ∈ S, and Jξ(k)(s) is concave, increasing in ξ for all k ≥ 0, s ∈ S. Hence, Jξ(s) is concave and increasing in ξ.
H.3 Proof of Proposition 5
Clearly, Jξ(s) is continuous in s over (0, 1), since otherwise concavity w.r.t. s will be violated. Now, since Jξ(s) is concave in s over (0, 1], we must have Jξ(1) ≤ lims↑1 Jξ(s). But since Jξ(s) is increasing in s, Jξ(1) ≥ lims↑1 Jξ(s). Hence, Jξ(1) = lims↑1 Jξ(s). Thus, Jξ(s) is continuous in s over (0, 1].
Again, for a ﬁxed s ∈ (0, 1], Jξ(s) is concave and increasing in ξ. Hence, Jξ(s) is continuous in ξ over ξ ∈ (0, c), ∀ c > 0. Hence, Jξ(s) is continuous in ξ over (0, ∞).

8. Remember that at state 0 (i.e., state EOL), the single stage cost is 0 irrespective of the action, and that this state is absorbing. Hence, any action at state 0 can be optimal.
