Abstract— In this paper, we introduce a preliminary model for interactions in the data market. Recent research has shown ways in which a data aggregator can design mechanisms for users to ensure the quality of data, even in situations where the users are effort-averse (i.e. prefer to submit lower-quality estimates) and the data aggregator cannot observe the effort exerted by the users (i.e. the contract suffers from the principalagent problem). However, we have shown that these mechanisms often break down in more realistic models, where multiple data aggregators are in competition. Under minor assumptions on the properties of the statistical estimators in use by data aggregators, we show that there is either no Nash equilibrium, or there is an inﬁnite number of Nash equilibrium. In the latter case, there is a fundamental ambiguity in who bears the burden of incentivizing different data sources. We are also able to calculate the price of anarchy, which measures how much social welfare is lost between the Nash equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e. between non-cooperative strategic play and cooperation.
I. INTRODUCTION
The proliferation of smart sensors in recent years has introduced the possibility of accurately detecting and estimating a large new class of phenomena that affect society. These sensors, ranging from smart personal devices to more traditional purpose-built sensors, may be owned by a multitude of sources, and can produce qualitatively different readings which can be combined to make inferences about an event of interest.
In turn, this has led to the advent of crowd sensing, wherein a central data collector accrues the measurements made by a multitude sources, using these data points to generate a single cohesive estimate for some phenomena of interest to the data collector. However, the quality of this central estimate, and thus its value to the data collector, depends fundamentally on the ability, and moreover the willingness, of the data sources to produce accurate readings which are relevant to the phenomena the data collector wishes to study.
Unfortunately, there may be instances where data sources have some aversion to providing the data collector with the quality of estimates she desires. Take as an example, the case where the sensor must exert signiﬁcant resources to produce an accurate reading (e.g. time or network bandwidth), or a situation where the source views the information she

is sharing as private, and has incentive to obfuscate the data she shares [1], [2]. Consequently, in order to ensure she consistently receives high quality measurements from the data sources, the central data collector must design an incentive mechanism which:
1) allows her to metricize the quality of the reading each data source provides, and
2) provides incentive for the data sources to produce readings which are considered ”high quality” under this metric.
Given the wide range of applications and industries this problem affects, many different compensation mechanisms have been proposed to promote the production of high quality readings from a collection of data sources. An overview of such mechanisms is given in [3].
The contribution of this section can be seen as an extension of [4], in which the authors design a general payment mechanism, by which a central data collector may induce each data source in the marketplace to exert precisely the level of effort in collecting data that the central data buyer desires. The goal of the data buyer in this case is to obtain a high quality estimator for some phenomena using the readings from the data sources, while reducing the payments needed to incentivize the necessary exertion of effort from the sensors. Several other papers [5], [6] further investigate mechanisms of this sort, proposing several extensions.
However, it has yet to be studied how such mechanisms perform in situations where more than one central data buyer wishes to purchase readings from data sources in the marketplace. A number of important questions arise when such data markets are considered. If the central data buyers are competing companies, will they permit data sources to also sell information to their competitors? If the data buyers do purchase readings from the same set of data sources, who will foot the bill to incentivize the effort the data sources exert? Will the data buyers who provide larger payments to the data sources be compensated with higher quality readings than their competitors?
Most signiﬁcantly, this section demonstrates that if all the data buyers design compensation schemes as proposed in [4], each of the data buyers will receive the same quality of reading from a particular data source, regardless of how much each data buyer personally compensates the data source for her effort. This leads to conﬂicting objectives for each of the data buyers on several fronts. If a data buyer wishes to induce a data source to exert a high level of effort, she must reconcile the fact that her competitors will also receive a high quality reading from this data source. Even in

the case where the data buyers care little about the success of the other buyers in the marketplace, each data buyer still wants to incentivize the data sources to produce high quality readings, but wants to force the other data buyers to offer the lion’s share of the necessary compensation.
In this section, we analyze the competitive outcomes that arise in such a marketplace by formulating a game between the buyers wherein they
1) compete by designing pricing mechanisms to affect the behavior of the data sources, and
2) design these mechanisms so as meet the personal objectives enumerated above.
We derive conditions for the existence of Nash Equilibria in this game when a particular form is assumed, and analyze the efﬁciency and equity of these outcomes. We demonstrate through both analytical and numerical exercises that the outcomes of these games are often highly inefﬁcient from a social standpoint, which motivates future work to design incentive mechanisms which more effectively handle competition between data buyers.
The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section II, we lay out explicit mathematical structures for the data markets, strategic data sources, strategic data buyers, and the class of contracts we will consider between the sources and buyers. In Section III, we analyze the game that forms between the buyers in the data market, and demonstrate that the outcome of this game is in many cases socially inefﬁcient, and often times. Section IV provides a numerical example which highlights the issues presented in Section III. And ﬁnally, Section V prescribes an agenda for future work, with the aim of developing more reﬁned incentive mechanism which do not suffer from the same shortcomings in the competitive setting.
II. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION
In this section we formulate our model for data markets. We ﬁrst present our model for strategic data sources, and then strategic buyers who issue incentives to strategic data sources. Based on recent research [4], we use incentives with a particular payment structure. Then, we deﬁne our overall game, as well as a generalized Nash equilibrium for this game.
A. Data market
At a high level, a data market consists of a set S = {1, ..., N } of strategic data sources, and a set B = {1, ..., M } of strategic data buyers. Each data source i is equipped to generate an estimate of the function f : D → R at some data point xi ∈ D, and each data buyer j ∈ B wishes to use these readings to generate a personal estimator of f , which we will denote fˆj. Each buyer bj is willing to form a contract with each data source i ∈ S, which monetarily compensates i for the readings she produces, and we assume it is under the purview of j to deﬁne the structure of this contract.
One may think of D as a set of features or events the data buyers are capable of observing, in order to make a prediction about some phenomena. The value returned

by the mapping f encapsulates the relationship between the observable features and the outcome of interest. We further assume that each of the data sources and buyers acts strategically; that is, each of these agents acts to maximize some expected personal return from her transactions in this marketplace. The following two subsections of the document provide an explicit mathematical formulation describing the behavior of the data sources and data buyers. The basis for these deﬁnitions comes directly from [4].

B. Strategic data sources

In this subsection, we deﬁne our model for strategic data sources. Intuitively, data sources provide data samples (x, y) whose variance depends on their effort. Thus, the more effort exerted, the better the statistical estimation for any data buyer who receives the data. Additionally, we assume the data sources are effort-averse, i.e. all else equal, they prefer to exert minimal effort. Furthermore, the buyer has no direct way to verify the amount of effort exerted by the data source. Thus, we have an issue commonly referred to as moral hazard.
More formally, all data sources share some function f : D → R, where f is the function which data buyers wish to estimate. One may think of D as a set of features or events the data buyers are capable of observing, in order to make a prediction about some phenomena. The value returned by the mapping f encapsulates the relationship between the observable features and the outcome of interest.
Each data source i has their own feature xi ∈ D and their own cost-of-effort function σi2 : R → R+. When data source i exerts effort ei ∈ R, they produce an estimate of the form:

yi(ei) = f (xi) + i(ei) i(ei) ∼ N (0, σi2(ei))

Both xi and σi2 are common knowledge, but the effort ei is private, as well as the the value yi(ei) produced. We shall design contracts such that the data source i is incentivized
to exert the ‘correct’ amount of effort (to be deﬁned), and
report yi truthfully. Data source i will receive a payment from each buyer for
their data. For buyer j, let this payment, potentially random, be denoted pji . We assume that the data source has a utility function of the following form, should they opt-in:





E  pji  − ei

(1)

j∈B

If they opt-out, they will receive utility 0. Note that this assumes that the data sources are risk-
neutral, effort-averse, and must opt-in ex-ante. Additionally, we assume the effort ei can be normalized to be comparable to the payments.
Throughout the rest of this paper, we shall often omit the argument ei when context makes it evident.

C. Strategic data buyers
A strategic data buyer j ∈ B is an agent who wishes to construct the best estimator fˆj for a function f . She

optimizes a loss function across a class of estimators, which the data buyer is free to select. In general, different buyers need not ﬁt models of the same type; for example, one data buyer may choose to generate her estimator via linear regression, while another data buyer constructs his estimator by ﬁtting the data to a polynomial model of higher degree. Differences in the type of estimator data buyers use may be used to encapsulate competitive advantages one data buyer has over another. For a more thorough review of the technical requirements of these estimators, see [4].
Additionally, each data buyer j has a distribution Fj across D, which denotes how much they value an accurate estimate at various points in D.
In particular, let fˆj denote the estimator that buyer j
(x, yj )
constructs, based on the location of the data sources, x, and the reports she receives from the data sources, yj. (Here, x = (x1, . . . , xN ) and similarly yj is the vector of y values reported to buyer j.)
Beyond any intrinsic utility buyer j experiences from increasing the quality of her estimator, j also wishes to construct an estimator that is better than the estimator constructed by her competitors, the other members of B.
Each data buyer j commits to a payment function pji to each data source i ∈ S, where pji : DN × RN → R may depend not only on the reading reported by data source i, but also the readings reported by the other members of S, with consideration given to the location of the data sources. In particular, buyer j constructs her various contracts with the data sources so as to minimize:

J j (pj , p−j ) = E

2
ˆj (x∗) − f (x∗) − fx,yj

2
j fˆk (x∗) − f (x∗) + ηj δk x,yk

(2) pji (x, yj )

k∈−j

i∈S

The expectation in (2) is taken across x∗ ∼ Fj as well as
the randomness in the reported data yk for k ∈ B. (Recall
that Fj weighs the importance data buyer j places on an an accurate estimator about different points x∗ ∈ D.) Here,
as per typical game theory notation, we will let −i denote
S \{i} and −j denote B \{j}, and when −i or −j is used as
a subscript, this denotes everyone else’s variables, e.g. p−j
denotes the vector of payment plans of all the data buyers
that are not j. Here, δkj ∈ [0, 1] parameterizes the level of competition
between buyers j and k, and we assume this competition is symmetric so δkj = δjk. When δkj = 0, j is indifferent to the success of k, and competes with k only insofar as trying
to determine who will pay to incentive the data sources. Meanwhile, δkj = 1 denotes a situation akin to a zero-sum game between data buyers j and k.
The parameter ηj > 0 denotes a conversion between dollar
amounts allocated by the payment functions and the utility
generated by the quality of the various estimators that are
constructed.
In order for the objective expressed in (2) to be well
deﬁned, we assume that buyer j chooses to construct an

estimator for which there exists a function gj such that, for all distributions F j over D, x, and σ2 ∈ RN :

2

2) = E fˆj (x∗) − f (x∗)

(3)

gj (x, Fj , σ x,yj

Here the yj have variance σ2. Finally, we assume that buyer j has knowledge of what
class of estimator each of the other data buyers plans to use.1 The data buyers are interested in offering payment con-
tracts to data sources. These contracts must be designed such that, for each data source i, when i selects her effort ei to maximize to (1), given the payment contracts from all of the other data buyers:





E  pji (yj(ei)) − ei ≥ 0

(4)

j∈B

E pji (yj(ei)) ≥ 0

(5)

Note that (4) is an ex-ante constraint for data source i that i receives non-negative payoff in expectation. This depends on the payments of the other data buyers. The second is an exante constraint that data source i never opts into any contract with negative payments.
We model the resulting competition between the data buyers, subject to these coupled constraints, as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) [7].

Deﬁnition 1. Each player j from a ﬁnite set of players B aims to solve an optimization problem given by:

BR(p−j) = arg min{J j(pj, p−j)|pj ∈ Mj(p−j)} (6)
pj
Mj(p−j) is called the feasible set for player j, which depends on the actions taken by the other players −j. A vector p = (p1, p2, . . . pM ) is called a (generalized) Nash equilibrium (GNE) if pj = BR(p−j) for all j ∈ B, i.e. the pj are simultaneously solutions to each players optimization (6).

Having laid out the general formulation for this problem, in the ﬁnal portion of this paper we lay out the form of the payment contracts that we consider between the buyers and sellers.

D. Structure of payment contracts

In [4] the particular case where |B| = 1 is analyzed, and

no competition between buyers of data must be considered.

Their work considers payment plans from the single buyer

to each data source i of the form:

2

ˆ j (xi) ,

(7)

pi(x, y) = ci − di yi − f(x,y )−i

where fˆ(x,y)−i (xi), is the optimal estimate for f (xi) that the data buyer can construct from the readings reported by the

1This is a heavy-handed assumption, given that competing data buyers are unlikely to inform their competitors how they intend to process the data supplied by the sources. However, this is keeping with the goal of the paper, as we shall demonstrate that even when there is complete information between the buyers, inefﬁciencies still arise in the data market.

data sources other than source i, and ci ≥ 0, di ≥ 0 are scalars to be chosen strategically by the buyer. The authors of [4] demonstrate an algorithm for selecting ci and di which allows the buyer to:
1) precisely incentive data source i to exert any level of effort e¯i that the buyer desires (the authors can make e¯i a dominant strategy for data source i), and
2) precisely compensate data source i for her effort (Epi(yi(e¯i), y−i(e¯−i)) = ei, making the contract tightly satisfy individual rationality constraints).
Our goal is to study how pricing schemes of this form perform in the more general case where |B| > 1, and competition between multiple data buyers becomes a critical consideration. In particular, we assume the following form for each of the incentive mechanisms offered in the data market.

Assumption 1. Consider a data buyer j and data source i. It is assumed that j offers i a payment function of the form

j (x, y) = cji − dji

yi

fˆj
(x,y)

pi −i

in exchange for knowledge of yi,where cji , dji ≥ 0 are parameters that the buyer j is free to choose.

Note that these payments do not directly depend on the level of effort that any of the data sources exert, since the data buyers do not have a means to directly observe these values. The payments only depend on the data reported to them, and can be calculated by data buyers. Having deﬁned the necessary structures for the data markets we wish to study, we are now ready to study the competitive equilibria that arise in these marketplaces.
First, we note that for any data source i, due to the form of the payment contract, they will report the same value to all data buyers.

Proposition 1. Fix any data source i. Pick any vector of
variances σ2 (one variance for each data buyer), and let e = max {e˜ : σi2(e˜) = (σ2)j}, i.e. e is the minimum amount of effort for data source i to generate measurements of variance
σ2. Then, data source i has higher payoff, deﬁned by (1), by choosing variances σi2(e) for all j, than the payoff earned from providing each buyer j with data of variance (σ2)j.

In other words, since the payment contract from each data buyer j is increasing (in expectation) with respect to effort, data source i will never have incentive to ‘add noise’ to a measurement once the effort has been exerted. Thus, for the rest of this paper, we shall write y to denote the measurement reported to all data sources j.

III. RESULTS
In this section, we analyze the behavior we can expect from each of the agents in the market place, by considering the game that forms between the members of B as they select the parameters in the contracts they offer to the data sources.
Adopting standard game-theoretic short-hand notion, we denote the set of pricing parameters buyer k selects by

(ck, dk) , and we denote the choice of the pricing parameters of the other members of B by (c−k, d−k). From now on, we

use the index k to single out a speciﬁc buyer, the index q to

single out a data source, the index j to sum over a collection

of buyers, and the index i (and sometimes l) to sum over a

collection of sources.

We begin our analysis by determining under what condi-

tions the data sources will accept the collection of contracts

offered to them by the data buyers. Recall that data source q

will accept all of the contracts offered by the data sources if

and only if the ex-ante total payments are non-negative (4)

and each data buyer’s payment is non-negative ex-ante (5).

Let δx denote the probability measure that puts mass 1 at point x. Then, we may simplify (4) for a ﬁxed q by noting

that:

Then, (4) holds if and only if:

cjq − djq σq2(eq) + gj (x¯−q, δxq , σ2−q) ≥ eq (9)

j∈B

j∈B

Similarly, (5) holds if and only if:

cjq ≥ djq σq2(eq) + gj (x¯−q, δxq , σ2−q)

(10)

As our goal is to ﬁnd situations where the buyers receive data from each of the data sources, we shall include equations (9) and (10) as constraints in the game between data buyers. Indeed, given a choice of (c−k, d−k), the objective of buyer k is to optimize the following problem:

min
ck ,dk
s.t.

J k((ck, dk), (c−k, d−k))

(12)

e∗i = arg maxei E j∈B pji (x, y(e∗)) − ei (13)

E pki (x, y(e)) ≥ 0

(14)

cki ≥ 0, dki ≥ 0

(15)

Each constraint holds for all i ∈ S. Recall that Jk was deﬁned in (2). Note that [4] showed that the payments induce dominant strategies, so (13) is an optimization that does not depend on e−i.
In general, this may be a computationally difﬁcult problem for bk to solve. For illustrative purposes, for the rest of this paper, we will assume speciﬁc forms for the estimators the buyers employ and the σ functions which deﬁne the data sources. We ﬁrst assume:

Assumption 2. For each data source i, σi(ei) is characterized by the the constant αi > 0 and of the form:

σi(ei) = exp(−αiei)

(16)

Note that this implies that σ is convex, strictly decreasing and always positive, which are all desirable properties in

our context. Furthermore, note that this is the form of the standard deviation, not the variance.
We next determine the level of effort data sources will exert given the pricing parameters set by the data buyers. Fix a data source q and taking the derivative of (1) with respect to eq, we obtain:

Setting this derivative equal to 0 yields:

ln 2 j∈B djq αq e∗q = 2αq (17)

This is the optimum effort selection for data source q. We can also compute how this optimal point varies with dji :

∂ e∗ = ∂djq q 2

Also we can easily calculate the optimum variance:

Assumption 3. (Separable estimators) For each buyer k ∈ B, the estimator for f that buyer k employs, fˆk, is separable.
In other words, there exists a function hk such that:

Furthermore, we assume that h ≥ 0.
Note that linear regression, polynomial regression and ﬁnite-kernel regression all produce separable estimators. Applying Assumption 3 for the estimators, we may rewrite the loss function for buyer k as:

J k((ck, dk), (c−k, d−k)) = hk(xi, x, Fk)σi2(e∗i ) −

Then, this becomes:

Every constraint above holds for all i ∈ S. Here, (22)

is a deﬁnitional, rather than binding, constraint. Also, note

that without loss of generality, we can take ηk = 1, by

normalizing the γik accordingly. Additionally, we can remove the constraint cki ≥ 0, as it is redundant in light of the

constraint cki − dki

ξik,l l∈S 2dtlotalαl

≥ 0, since ξ ≥ 0 and

d ≥ 0.

This leads to the following result.

Theorem 1. Consider the game where each buyer’s objective is to solve the optimization in (19), and assume γij ≥ 0 for all i ∈ S, j ∈ B. Then there are either an inﬁnite number of generalized Nash equilibria, or there is no generalized Nash equilibrium.
Furthermore, in the case where there are an inﬁnite number of generalized Nash equilibria, there is a unique collection of d parameters, in the sense that if (c, d) and
(c , d ) are both generalized Nash equilibria, then d = d . Additionally, the c parameters lie in the convex polytope deﬁned by the following constraints:

ξik,l l∈S 2dtlotalαl

The effort exerted by each data source is the same in each generalized Nash equilibrium.

Before proving this theorem, we discuss the assumption that γij ≥ 0. This implies that, for each data buyer, the penalty for other data buyer’s successful estimation does
not outweigh the beneﬁt of having a good estimator. This
assumption means that no data buyer will have incentive to
drive the variance of one data source up towards inﬁnity. We prove the following useful lemma, and then prove our
theorem.

Lemma 1. Suppose (c, d) is a GNE for the game deﬁned by (19). The following equality holds for all i and k:

cki = dji
j∈B

ξij,l l∈S 2dtlotalαl

+ ln 2dtiotalαi 2αi

−

cji

j∈−k

In other words, (20) is always tight in equilibrium.

Proof. To prove this, note that, by the cost function of buyer k, cki will always be chosen such that at least one of (20) and (21) is tight. Suppose (21) is exclusively active, i.e.

k

ξik,l

cki > dji
j∈B

ξij,l l∈S 2dtlotalαl

+ ln 2dtiotalαi 2αi

−

cji

j∈−k
(24)

Note that (24) is the same constraint for every data buyer.

In other words, if it is loose for k, it is loose for all other j. Thus, some other buyer j can reduce their cji and lower
their cost, and thus (c, d) cannot be an equilibrium.

This argument does fall apart in one situation, however.

No buyer can reduce their cost just by modifying c if (21)

is tight for all buyers k, i.e. for all k:

k

k

ξik,l

ci − di l∈S 2dtlotalαl = 0

In this case, (20), which we assumed held loosely, becomes

2dtiotalαi < 1. Let buyer k increase dki such that 2dtiotalαi = 1, and then choose a new ck such that (21) holds tightly, i.e.

ck = dki

ξik,l . Note that this decreases their
l∈S 2dtlotalαl

cost:

γik

k

i∈S 2dtiotalαi > i∈S γi

(This uses the fact that, since (21) holds for all buyers j, the

second term disappears.) Additionally, all the constraints of

the

still

satisﬁed,

so

This concludes our proof.

Proof. (Theorem 1) We invoke Lemma 1 and substitute this into the objective function, (19), for buyer k. Let:

J c, d =
i∈S

γik + 2dtiotalαi

dji
j∈−k

ξij,l l∈S 2dtlotalαl

− cji

+ ln 2dtiotalαi 2αi

This yields:

min

subject to

J c, d

cki − dki

ξik,l l∈S 2dtlotalαl

dtiotal = j∈B dji dki ≥ 0

We quickly manipulate the cost function a little to a more
desirable form: γik +

+ ln 2dtiotalαi 2αi

Note the index swap on the ξ terms in the second equality. Then deﬁne:

Ji (di , c , d ) = 2dtiotalαi +

Thus, the overall optimization can again be re-written:

We differentiate the cost with respect to dkq :

Note that we use the fact that ξqj,q = 1 for all j. It is easy to see that:



Thus, the maximizing dkq is given by:

dkq = γqk +

djl ξlj,q

j∈−k l∈−q

(25)

Performing this analysis for all combinations of q ∈ S and
k ∈ B yields a system of M × N equations with M × N
unknowns, of the form (25).
As we have before, let d denote a column vector with entries dji for each i ∈ S and j ∈ B. Similarly, let γ denote a column vector containing all the terms of the form γij. Then, we may represent this system of equations with the
following matrix equation:

d = Ad + γ

(26)

Here, A is a non-negative matrix whose entries are the values

of the various ξ parameters at the appropriate places, such

that (26) expresses the set of equality constraints deﬁned by

(25) for all q ∈ S and k ∈ B. To ﬁnd an GNE of this game, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a solution to (26) such that dji ≥ 0 for all
i and j.

Systems of equations of this form are well studied in the

economics literature, as they are of the form speciﬁed by the

celebrated Leontief input-output model. It has been shown

that such systems of equations have a non-negative solution

if and only if ρ(A) < 1, where ρ(A) is the spectral radius of

A [8]. Moreover, if such a solution exists, it must be unique.

Thus, if ρ(A) < 1, inversion of this A matrix yields the

equilibrium d, and, by Lemma 1, we can pick any c that

satisﬁes:

cji = dji

j∈−B

j∈B

ξij,l l∈S 2dtlotalαl

+ ln 2dtiotalαi 2αi

cki ≥ dki

ξik,l l∈S 2dtlotalαl

If ρ(A) ≥ 1, there will not exist a non-negative solution and there is no point (c, d) that simultaneously optimizes (19) for all k. It follows that there is either a unique d that will constitute a Nash solution for the game, which produces a convex polytope of potential GNE, or there this no solution to the game, as desired.

It is interesting to note that the existence of GNE depends solely on the value of the ξ parameters; it does not depend on the magnitude of the γ parameters. This implies that the existence or non-existence of GNE in this game is simply an artifact of the incentive mechanisms we have chosen to analyze, and does not depend on whether or not there are solutions that are beneﬁcial to all parties involved. Note that we chose this incentive mechanism based on several desirable properties in the single-buyer case; whether or not there exist mechanisms that extend to multi-buyer games in

a fashion that provides good efﬁciency properties is an open problem that we are currently investigating. In Section IV, we calculate the ξ parameters for a speciﬁc example, and see how equilibrium solutions in these marketplaces collapse as the characteristics are varied.
Additionally, note that, in the case where there is a continuum of GNE, the effort exerted by data sources and d parameters are the same across all equilibria. The ambiguity arises in the c parameters. In other words, the ambiguity arises in determining which data buyers will pay to ensure that each data source’s total compensation covers the cost of their effort. In the extreme case, it is possible for one ﬁrm to pay for the entirety of the expected compensation offered to the data sources, while the the ﬁrms pay nothing on expectation. That is, for some k ∈ B, i∈S pki (x, y) =
i∈S e∗i , and for all j = k, i∈S pji (x, y) = 0. In Section V we discuss possible mechanisms to alleviate the disparity that may arise in these situations.
We next turn to analyzing the total utility experienced in the marketplace for a given outcome of the game. We begin with the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2. (Ex-ante social loss of the data market) Suppose that ηj = 1 for all buyers j. Let e be the vector denoting the level of effort the data sources exert. Then, we deﬁne the ex-ante social loss the marketplace to be the sum of the utility functions of all the data buyers and data sources:

L(e) =

E

j∈B

2
ˆj (x∗) − f (x∗) − fx,yj

δkj
k∈−j

2
ˆk (x∗) − f (x∗) fx,yk

+ ei
i∈S

Note that this sum does not include any of the payments made in the marketplace, as they are simply lossless transfers of wealth. We require the additionally assumption that ηj = 1 for all buyers j to ensure that these transfers of wealth are lossless from a utility perspective, i.e. the buyers and sources value the payment equally. This assumption allows us to isolate the social loss due to the mechanism, and ignore any losses due to differential preferences in payment currency.

Theorem 2. Suppose that Assumptions 2 and 3 hold. Further, assume that γij > 0, for all i ∈ S and j ∈ B, and that ξij,l > 0 for some i, l ∈ S, j ∈ B. Finally, suppose GNE solutions exist for the game, and let e∗ denote the unique level of effort exerted by the data sources across each of these GNE solutions, as stipulated by Theorem 1. Then, there exists eˆ ∈ RN such that L eˆ < L e∗ . Furthermore, the
socially optimal levels of effort, eˆ, are always less than the induced levels of effort at equilibrium e∗.

Proof. We begin by calculating solving for the value of eˆ which minimizes the value of L eˆ . Invoking Assumption 3 and our deﬁnition of γ, we may write:

L eˆ =

γij σi2(eˆi) + eˆi

(27)

i∈S j∈B

i∈S

Taking the derivative with respect to eˆq and repeating our analysis with Assumption 2, and setting the resulting equation to zero we obtain:





−2αq  γqj exp(−2αqeˆq) + 1 = 0
j∈B

We can re-arrange this to yield: ln(2αq j∈B γqj )
eˆq = 2αq (28)

Note, that L is strictly convex with respect to eˆq, so choosing the entries of eˆ according to equation (28) must
produce the unique minimizer of L eˆ .
Next we compare this to the level of effort the sources produce in the GNE of the game between the buyers. By (25), we obtain that in the GNE for all i ∈ S and k ∈ B:

dki = γik +

djl ξlj,i ≥ γik > 0

j∈−k l∈−i

Furthermore, since there exists at least one ξ > 0, we know that dkq > γqk for some data source q and buyer k. It follows that, for this particular q:

djq > γqj

j∈B

j∈B

Thus, by (17), we see that

∗ ln(2αq j∈B djq) ln(2αq j∈B γqj )

eq =

2αq

>

2αq

= eˆq. (29)

Thus the theorem is proved, since it must be the case that L eˆ < L e∗ since we chose eˆ to be the unique minimizer of L.

Theorem 2 shows that there is always some social loss, exante, from a Nash solution compared to the social optimum. Furthermore, the proof provides a way to identify where this loss is incurred, and how to calculate how much is lost. Note that the social welfare is always lost because the effort induced in equilibrium is higher than is socially optimal. This captures the intuition that each data buyer has a negative externality: they wish to improve their estimates without considering how their improved estimates hurt other data buyers.
The proof itself also provides strong intuition on the ξ parameters between buyers. Loosely speaking, these ξ parameters can be thought of as a measure of each buyer’s ‘market power’, in the sense that it quantiﬁes how much one buyer can inﬂuence the payment contracts of other buyers in the data market to his advantage. As an extremal case, when ξij,l = 0 for all i, l ∈ S and j ∈ B, there is no coupling between the payments the buyers make, and the social optimum coincides with the Nash solution.

IV. EXAMPLE: BETWEEN TWO FIRMS
In this section, we present an example which demonstrates how a data market may collapse as the parameters of the system are varied. This example will also demonstrate how the efﬁciency of the data market, in terms of the ex-ante social loss function L, changes as the market approaches this collapse. In particular, we consider the case where there are two data sources (s1 and s2) and two ﬁrms acting as data buyers (b1 and b2). Each of the data sources is capable of estimating the function

f : [−1, 1] → R.

(30)

Let x1, x2 ∈ [−1, 1] denote the locations where s1 and s2 sample f , respectively. Assume that each of the data sources are as deﬁned in Assumption 2, with the characteristic parameters α1 = α2 = 1.
Next, we assume that each of the data buyers is performing linear regression on f , using the samples reported by the data source. In this case [4]:

gj (x, Fj , σ2(e)) = Ex∗∼Fj

x∗ T (XT X)−1XT · 1

diag(σ12(e1), σ22(e2)) · X(XT X)−1 x1∗ =

γ1j σ12(e1) + γ2j σ22(e2)

In this example, we assume F1 = F2 as the uniform distribution on the domain of f , [−1, 1]. Thus, for i ∈ {1, 2}:

1 2 (x1 − x2)2/3 + (x2i − x1x2)2

γi = γi =

(x2 + x2 − 2x1x2)2

2

Note that, by these assumptions, g1 = g2, and furthermore:

(x1x2 + 1)2

ξ1,2 = ξ1,2 = g(x2, δx1 , σ2(e2)) = (x2 + 1)2

2

2

(x1x2 + 1)2

ξ2,1 = ξ2,1 = g(x1, δx2 , σ1(e1)) = (x2 + 1)2

1

For illustrative purposes, we ﬁx x2 = 1, and see what happens to the data market as we vary x1 along the interval [−1, 1].
Note that, when x1 = x2 = 1, it is no longer possible to construct a linear estimator of f because there is insufﬁcient data. Thus, the example shows how the game between buyers behaves as it becomes increasingly difﬁcult to construct good estimators. The d parameters of any Nash solution can be found by solving:

Note that this B matrix is equal to I − A as deﬁned in the proof. We numerically solve this system of equations for varying values of x1 ∈ [−1, 1], and the results are shown in Figures 1 through 4.

Figures 1 and 2, demonstrate how the γ and ξ parameters of the game change as a function of x1. Figure 3 demonstrates the d parameters that the buyers will offer the data sources as x1 varies. And ﬁnally, Figure demonstrates the price of anarchy in the data market, as a function of x1 which is given by:
L e∗
L eˆ
Here, e∗ is the induced effort of the sensors in the Nash solution of the game between data buyers, and eˆ is the socially optimal effort for data sources to exert. Further comments in the captions of Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate the inefﬁciencies that arise in this example.

V. CLOSING REMARKS
We’ve analyzed the game that forms between a set of data buyers when they wish to communally incentivize a collection of strategic data sources, using a mechanism that has been proposed in the literature. We derived, for a particular form of the game, conditions for the existence of GNE, and demonstrated that these solutions are frequently socially inefﬁcient. This motivates future work to develop a

Fig. 3. This ﬁgure depicts the Nash equilibrium d parameters for the game between the buyers as a function of x1. Note that, as x1 → 1, the d parameters go off to inﬁnity, and the Nash equilibria between the buyers breaks down. Comparing these results to Figure 1, we see that the
d parameters diverge much more quickly than the γ parameters, meaning that in the Nash equilibria to the game between the two buyers becomes increasingly inefﬁcient as x1 → 1.

Fig. 4. This ﬁgure depicts the price of anarchy for the marketplace as a function of x1. When x1 = −1, the payments in the marketplace are decoupled and the ξ parameters are all zero; in this instance the price of anarchy is 1, and the market is perfectly efﬁcient. However, as x1 → 1, the price of anarchy diverges asymptotically to inﬁnity, and the marketplace becomes increasingly inefﬁcient as it becomes more difﬁcult for the buyers to construct the estimators they desire.
