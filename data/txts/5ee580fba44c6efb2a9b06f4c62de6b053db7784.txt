Abstract
It is common to see a handful of reviewers reject a highly novel paper, because they view, say, extensive experiments as far more important than novelty, whereas the community as a whole would have embraced the paper. More generally, the disparate mapping of criteria scores to ﬁnal recommendations by different reviewers is a major source of inconsistency in peer review. In this paper we present a framework inspired by empirical risk minimization (ERM) for learning the community’s aggregate mapping. The key challenge that arises is the speciﬁcation of a loss function for ERM. We consider the class of L(p, q) loss functions, which is a matrix-extension of the standard class of Lp losses on vectors; here the choice of the loss function amounts to choosing the hyperparameters p, q ∈ [1, ∞]. To deal with the absence of ground truth in our problem, we instead draw on computational social choice to identify desirable values of the hyperparameters p and q. Speciﬁcally, we characterize p = q = 1 as the only choice of these hyperparameters that satisﬁes three natural axiomatic properties. Finally, we implement and apply our approach to reviews from IJCAI 2017.
1. Introduction
The essence of science is the search for objective truth, yet scientiﬁc work is typically evaluated through peer review1 — a notoriously subjective process (Church, 2005; Lamont, 2009; Bakanic et al., 1987; Hojat et al., 2003; Mahoney, 1977; Kerr et al., 1977). One prominent source of subjectivity is the disparity across reviewers in terms of their emphasis on the various criteria used for the overall evaluation of a paper. Lee (2015) refers to this disparity as commensuration bias, and describes it as follows:
“In peer review, reviewers, editors, and grant program ofﬁcers must make interpretive decisions about how to weight the relative importance of qualitatively different peer review criteria — such as novelty, signiﬁcance, and methodological soundness — in their assessments of a submission’s ﬁnal/overall value. Not all peer review criteria get equal weight; further, weightings can vary across reviewers and contexts even when reviewers are given identical instructions.”
Lee (2015) further argues that commensuration bias “illuminates how intellectual priorities in individual peer review judgments can collectively subvert the attainment of community-wide goals” and

that it “permits and facilitates problematic patterns of publication and funding in science.” There have been, however, very few attempts to address this problem.
A fascinating exception, which serves as a case in point, is the 27th AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI 2013). Reviewers were asked to score papers, on a scale of 1–6, according to the following criteria: technical quality, experimental analysis, formal analysis, clarity/presentation, novelty of the question, novelty of the solution, breadth of interest, and potential impact. The admirable goal of the program chairs was to select “exciting but imperfect papers” over “safe but solid” papers, and, to this end, they provided detailed instructions on how to map the foregoing criteria to an overall recommendation. For example, the preimage of ‘strong accept’ is “a 5 or 6 in some category, no 1 in any category,” that is, reviewers were instructed to strongly accept a paper that has a 5 or 6 in, say, clarity, but is below average according to each and every other criterion (i.e., a clearly boring paper). It turns out that the handcrafted mapping did not work well, and many of the reviewers chose to not follow these instructions. Indeed, handcrafting such a mapping requires specifying an 8-dimensional function, which is quite a non-trivial task. Consequently, in this paper we do away with a manual handcrafting approach to this problem.
Instead, we propose a data-driven approach based on machine learning, designed to learn a mapping from criteria scores to recommendations capturing the opinion of the entire (reviewer) community. From a machine learning perspective, the examples are reviews, each consisting of criteria scores (the input point) and an overall recommendation (the label). We make the innocuous assumption that each reviewer has a monotonic mapping in mind, in the sense that a paper whose scores are at least as high as those of another paper on every criterion would receive an overall recommendation that is at least as high; the reviews submitted by a particular reviewer can be seen as observations of that mapping. Given this data, our goal is to learn a single monotonic mapping that minimizes a loss function (which we discuss momentarily). We can then apply this mapping to the criteria scores associated with each review to obtain new overall recommendations, which replace the original ones.
Our approach to learn this mapping is inspired by empirical risk minimization (ERM). In more detail, for some loss function, our approach is to ﬁnd a mapping that, among all monotonic mappings from criteria scores to the overall scores, minimizes the loss between its outputs and the overall scores given by reviewers across all reviews. However, the choice of loss function may signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁnal outcome, so that choice is a key issue.
Speciﬁcally, we focus on the family of L(p, q) loss functions, with hyperparameters p, q ∈ [1, ∞], which is a matrix-extension of the more popular family of Lp losses on vectors. Our question, then, is:
What values of the hyperparameters p ∈ [1, ∞] and q ∈ [1, ∞] in the speciﬁcation of the L(p, q) loss function should be used?
A challenge we must address is the absence of any ground truth in peer review. To this end, take the perspective of computational social choice (Brandt et al., 2016), since our framework aggregates individual opinions over mappings into a consensus mapping. From this viewpoint, it is natural to select the loss function so that the resulting aggregation method satisﬁes socially desirable properties, such as consensus (if all reviewers agree then the aggregate mapping should coincide with their recommendations), efﬁciency (if one paper dominates another then its overall recommendation should be at least as high), and strategyproofness (reviewers cannot pull the aggregate mapping closer to their own recommendations by misreporting them).

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW
With this background, the main contributions of this paper are as follows. We ﬁrst provide a principled framework for addressing the issue of subjectivity regarding the various criteria in peer review.
Our main theoretical result is a characterization theorem that gives a decisive answer to the question of choosing the loss function for ERM: the three aforementioned properties are satisﬁed if and only if the hyperparameters are set as p = q = 1. This result singles out an instantiation of our approach that we view as particularly attractive and well grounded.
We also provide empirical results, which analyze properties of our approach when applied to a dataset of 9197 reviews from IJCAI 2017. One vignette is that the papers selected by L(1, 1) aggregation have a 79.2% overlap with actual list of accepted papers, suggesting that our approach makes a signiﬁcant difference compared to the status quo (arguably for the better).
Finally, we note that the approach taken in this paper may ﬁnd other applications. Indeed, the problem of selecting a loss function is ubiquitous in machine learning (Rosasco et al., 2004; Masnadi-Shirazi and Vasconcelos, 2008; Mei et al., 2018), and the axiomatic approach provides a novel way of addressing it. Going beyond loss functions, machine learning researchers frequently face the difﬁculty of picking an appropriate hypothesis class or values for certain hyperparameters.2 Thus, in problem settings where such choices must be made — particularly in emerging applications of machine learning (such as peer review) — the use of natural axioms can help guide these choices.
2. Our Framework
Suppose there are n reviewers R = {1, 2, . . . , n}, and a set P of m papers, denoted using letters such as a, b, c. Each reviewer i reviews a subset of papers, denoted by P (i) ⊆ P. Conversely, let R(a) denote the set of all reviewers who review paper a. Each reviewer assigns scores to each of their papers on d different criteria, such as novelty, experimental analysis, and technical quality, and also gives an overall recommendation. We denote the criteria scores given by reviewer i to paper a by xia, and the corresponding overall recommendation by yia. Let X1, X2, . . . , Xd denote the domains of the d criteria scores, and let X = X1 × X2 × · · · × Xd. Also, let Y denote the domain of the overall recommendations. For concreteness, we assume that each Xk as well as Y is the real line. However, our results hold more generally, even if these domains are non-singleton intervals in R, for instance.
We further assume that each reviewer has a monotonic function in mind that they use to compute the overall recommendation for a paper from its criteria scores. By a monotonic function, we mean that given any two score vectors x and x , if x is greater than or equal to x on all coordinates, then the function’s value on x must be at least as high as its value on x . Formally, for each reviewer i, there exists gi ∈ F such that yia = gi (xia) for all a ∈ P (i), where
F = {f : X → Y | ∀x, x ∈ X, x ≥ x ⇒ f (x) ≥ f (x )}
is the set of all monotonic functions.
2.1. Loss Functions
Recall that our goal is to use all criteria scores, and their corresponding overall recommendations, to learn an aggregate function f that captures the opinions of all reviewers on how criteria scores

should be mapped to recommendations. Inspired by empirical risk minimization, we do this by computing the function in F that minimizes the L(p, q) loss on the data. In more detail, given hyperparameters p, q ∈ [1, ∞], we compute

f ∈F i∈R a∈P (i)

 

In words, for a function f , the L(p, q) loss is the Lq norm taken over the loss associated with individual reviewers, where the latter loss is deﬁned as the Lp norm computed on the error of f with respect to the reviewer’s overall recommendations. The L(p, q) loss is a matrix-extension of the more popular Lp losses on vectors, and relates to the L(p, q) norm of a matrix which has had many applications in machine learning (Ding et al., 2006; Kong et al., 2011; Nie et al., 2010). We refer to aggregation by minimizing L(p, q) loss as deﬁned in Equation (1) as L(p, q) aggregation.
Equation (1) does not specify how to break ties between multiple minimizers. For concreteness, we select the minimizer f with minimum empirical L2 norm. Formally, letting

be the set of all L(p, q) loss minimizers, we break ties by choosing

(2)

f ∈F

i∈R a∈P (i)

Observe that since the L(p, q) loss and constraint set are convex, F is also a convex set. Hence, f as deﬁned by Equation (2) is unique. We emphasize that although we use minimum L2 norm for tie-breaking, all of our results hold under any reasonable tie-breaking method, such as the minimum Lk norm for any k ∈ (1, ∞).
Once the function f has been computed, it can be applied to every review (for all reviewers i and papers a) to obtain a new overall recommendation f (xia). There is a separate — almost orthogonal — question of how to aggregate the overall recommendations of several reviewers on a paper into a single recommendation (typically this is done by taking the average). In our theoretical results we are agnostic to how this additional aggregation step is performed, but we return to it in our experiments in Section 4.
We remark that an alternative approach would be to learn a monotonic function gi : X → Y for each reviewer (which best captures their recommendations), and then aggregate these functions into a single function f . We chose not to pursue this approach, because in practice there are very few examples per reviewer, so it is implausible that we would be able to accurately learn the reviewers’ individual functions.

2.2. Axiomatic Properties
In social choice theory, the most common approach — primarily attributed to Arrow (1951) — for comparing different aggregation methods is to determine which desirable axioms they satisfy. We

4

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW
take the same approach in order to determine the values of the hyperparameters p and q for the L(p, q) aggregation in Equation (1).
We stress that axioms are deﬁned for aggregation methods and not aggregate functions. Informally, an aggregation method is a function that takes as input all the reviews {(xia, yia)}i∈R,a∈P (i), and outputs an aggregate function f : X → Y. We do not deﬁne an aggregation method formally to avoid introducing cumbersome notation that will largely be useless later. It is clear that for any choice of hyperparameters p, q ∈ [1, ∞], L(p, q) aggregation (with tie-breaking as deﬁned by Equation 2) is an aggregation method.
Social choice theory essentially relies on counterfactual reasoning to identify scenarios where it is clear how an aggregation method should behave. To give one example, the Pareto efﬁciency property of voting rules states that if all voters prefer alternative a to alternative b, then b should not be elected; this situation is extremely unlikely to occur, yet Pareto efﬁciency is obviously a property that any reasonable voting must satisfy. With this principle in mind, we identify a setting in our problem where the requirements are very clear, and then deﬁne our axioms in that setting.
For all of our axioms, we restrict attention to scenarios where every reviewer reviews every paper, that is, P (i) = P for every i. Moreover, we assume that the papers have ‘objective’ criteria scores, that is, the criteria scores given to a paper are the same across all reviewers, so the only source of disagreement is how the criteria scores should be mapped to an overall recommendation. We can then denote the criteria scores of a paper a simply as xa, as opposed to xia, since they do not depend on i. We stress that our framework does not require these assumptions to hold — they are only used in our axiomatic characterization, namely Theorem 4 in the next section.
An axiom is satisﬁed by an aggregation method if its statement holds for every possible number of reviewers n and number of papers m, and for all possible criteria scores and overall recommendations. We start with the simplest axiom, consensus, which informally states that if there is a paper such that all reviewers give it the same overall recommendation, then f must agree with the reviewers; this axiom is closely related to the unanimity axiom in social choice.
Axiom 1 (Consensus) For any paper a ∈ P, if all reviewers report identical overall recommendations y1a = y2a = · · · = yma = r for some r ∈ Y, then f (xa) = r.
Before presenting the next axiom, we require another deﬁnition: we say that paper a ∈ P dominates paper b ∈ P if there exists a bijection σ : R → R such that for all i ∈ R, yia ≥ yσ(i)b. Equivalently (and less formally), paper a dominates paper b if the sorted overall recommendations given to a pointwise-dominate the sorted overall recommendations given to b. Intuitively, in this situation, a should receive a (weakly) higher overall recommendation than b, which is exactly what the axiom requires; it is similar to the classic Pareto efﬁciency axiom mentioned above.
Axiom 2 (Efﬁciency) For any pair of papers a, b ∈ P, if a dominates b, then f (xa) ≥ f (xb).
Our positive result, which will be presented shortly, satisﬁes this notion of efﬁciency. On the other hand, we also use this axiom to prove a negative result; an important note is that the negative result requires a condition that is signiﬁcantly weaker than the aforementioned deﬁnition of efﬁciency. We revisit this point at the end of Section 3.2.1.
Our ﬁnal axiom is strategyproofness, a game-theoretic property that plays a major role in social choice theory (Moulin, 1983). Intuitively, strategyproofness means that reviewers have no incentive
5

to misreport their overall recommendations: They cannot bring the aggregate recommendations — the community’s consensus about the relative importance of various criteria — closer to their own through strategic manipulation.

Axiom 3 (Strategyproofness) For each reviewer i ∈ R, and all possible manipulated recommendations yi ∈ Ym, if yi = (yi1, yi2, . . . , yim) is replaced with yi, then

(f (x1), . . . , f (xm)) − yi 2 ≤ (g(x1), . . . , g(xm)) − yi 2,

(3)

where f and g are the aggregate functions obtained from the original and manipulated reviews, respectively.

The implicit ‘utilities’ in this axiom (3) are deﬁned in terms of the L2 norm. This choice is made only for concreteness, and all our results hold for any norm L , ∈ [1, ∞], in the deﬁnition (3).

3. Main Result
In Section 2, we introduced L(p, q) aggregation as a family of rules for aggregating individual opinions towards a consensus mapping from criteria scores to recommendations. But that deﬁnition, in and of itself, leaves open the question of how to choose the values of p and q in a way that leads to the most socially desirable outcomes. The axioms of Section 2.2 allow us to give a satisfying answer to this question. Speciﬁcally, our main theoretical result is a characterization of L(p, q) aggregation in terms of the three axioms.
Theorem 4 L(p, q) aggregation, where p, q ∈ [1, ∞], satisﬁes consensus, efﬁciency, and strategyproofness if and only if p = q = 1.
We remark that for p = q, Equation (1) does not distinguish between different reviewers, that is, the aggregation method pools all reviews together. We ﬁnd this interesting, because the L(p, q) aggregation framework does have enough power to make that distinction, but the axioms guide us towards a speciﬁc solution, L(1, 1), which does not.
Turning to the proof of the theorem, we start from the easier ‘if’ direction.
3.1. p = q = 1 Satisﬁes All Three Axioms
Lemma 5 L(p, q) aggregation with p = q = 1 satisﬁes consensus, efﬁciency and strategyproofness.
Proof The key idea of the proof lies in the form taken by the minimizer of L(1, 1) loss. When each reviewer reviews every paper and the papers have objective criteria scores, L(1, 1) aggregation reduces to computing

f ∈ argmin

|yia − f (xa)| ,

(4)

f ∈F

i∈R a∈P

where ties are broken by picking the minimizer with minimum L2 norm. We claim that the aggregate function is given by
f (xa) = left-med({yia}i∈R) ∀a ∈ P,

where left-med(·) of a set of points is their left median. We prove this claim by showing four parts:

6

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW

(i) f is a valid function,
(ii) f is an unconstrained minimizer of the objective in (4),
(iii) f satisﬁes the constraints of (4), i.e., f ∈ F, and
(iv) f has the minimum L2 norm among all minimizers of (4).
We start by proving part (i). This part can only be violated if there are two papers a and b such that xa = xb, but left-med({yia}i∈R) = left-med({yib}i∈R), leading to f having two function values for the same x-value. However, we assumed that each reviewer i has a function gi used to score the papers. So, for the two papers a and b, we would have yia = gi (xa) = gi (xb) = yib for every i, giving us left-med({yia}i∈R) = left-med({yib}i∈R). Therefore, f is a valid function.
For part (ii), consider the optimization problem (4) without any constraints. Denote the objective function as G(f ). Rearranging terms, we obtain

G(f ) =

|yia − f (xa)| .

(5)

a∈P i∈R

Consider the inner summation i∈R |yia − f (xa)|; it is obvious that this quantity is minimized when f (xa) is any median of the {yia}i∈R values. Hence, we have

G(f ) =

|yia − f (xa)|

a∈P i∈R

≥

|yia − left-med({yia}i∈R)|

(6)

a∈P i∈R

= G(f ),

where f is an arbitrary function. Therefore, f minimizes the objective function even in the absence
of any constraints, proving part (ii). Turning to part (iii), we show that f satisﬁes the monotonicity constraints, i.e., f ∈ F. Suppose
a, b ∈ P are such that xa ≥ xb. Using the fact that each reviewer i scores papers based on the function gi , we have yia = gi (xa) and yib = gi (xb). And since gi ∈ F obeys monotonicity constraints, we obtain yia ≥ yib for every i. This trivially implies that left-med({yia}i∈R) ≥ left-med({yib}i∈R), i.e., f (xa) ≥ f (xb), completing part (iii).
Finally, we prove part (iv). Observe that Equation (6) is a strict inequality if there is a paper a for which f (xa) is not a median of the {yia}i∈R values. In other words, the only functions f that have the same objective function value as f are of the form

f (xa) ∈ med({yia}i∈R) ∀a ∈ P,

(7)

where med(·) of a collection of points is the set of all points between (and including) the left and right medians. Hence, all other minimizers of (4) must satisfy Equation (7). Observe that f is pointwise smaller than any of these functions, since it computes the left median at each of the xvalues. Therefore, f has the minimum L2 norm among all possible minimizers of (4), completing the proof of part (iv).

7

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW
Combining all four parts proves that f is indeed the aggregate function chosen by L(1, 1) aggregation. We use this to prove that L(1, 1) aggregation satisﬁes consensus, efﬁciency and strategyproofness.
Consensus. Let a ∈ P be a paper such that y1a = y2a = · · · = yma = r for some r. Then, left-med({yia}i∈R) = r. Hence, f (xa) = r, satisfying consensus.
Efﬁciency. Let a, b ∈ P be such that a dominates b. In other words, the sorted overall recommendations given to a pointwise-dominate the sorted overall recommendations given to b. So, by deﬁnition, left-med({yia}i∈R) is at least as large as left-med({yib}i∈R). That is, f (xa) ≥ f (xb), satisfying efﬁciency.
Strategyproofness. Let i be an arbitrary reviewer. Observe that in this setting, the aggregate score f (xa) of a paper a depends only on the score yia and not on other scores {yib}b=a given by reviewer i. In other words, the only way to manipulate f (xa) = left-med({yi a}i ∈R) is by changing yia. Consider three cases. Suppose yia < f (xa). In this case, if reviewer i reports yia ≤ f (xa), then there is no change in the aggregate score of a. On the other hand, if yia > f (xa), then either the aggregate score of a remains the same or increases, making things only worse for reviewer i. The other case of yia > f (xa) is symmetric to yia < f (xa). Consider the third case, yia = f (xa). In this case, manipulation can only make things worse since we already have |yia − f (xa)| = 0. In summary, reporting yia instead of yia cannot help decrease |yia − f (xa)|. Also, recall that yia does not affect the aggregate scores of other papers, and hence manipulation of yia does not help them either. Therefore, by manipulating any of the yia scores, reviewer i cannot bring the aggregate recommendations closer to her own, proving strategyproofness.
3.2. Violation of the Axioms When (p, q) = (1, 1)
We now tackle the harder ‘only if’ direction of Theorem 4. We do so in three steps: efﬁciency is violated by p ∈ (1, ∞) and q = 1 (Lemma 6), strategyproofness is violated by L(p, q) aggregation for all q > 1 (Lemma 7), and consensus is violated by p = ∞ and q = 1 (Lemma 8). Together, the three lemmas leave p = q = 1 as the only option. Below we state the lemmas and give some proof ideas; the theorem’s full proof is relegated to Appendix A.
It is worth noting that, although we have presented the lemmas as components in the proof of Theorem 4, they also have standalone value (some more than others). For example, if one decided that only strategyproofness is important, then Lemma 7 below would give signiﬁcant guidance on choosing an appropriate method.
3.2.1. VIOLATION OF EFFICIENCY
In our view, the following lemma presents the most interesting and counter-intuitive result in the paper.
Lemma 6 L(p, q) aggregation with p ∈ (1, ∞) and q = 1 violates efﬁciency.
It is quite surprising that such reasonable loss functions violate the simple requirement of efﬁciency. In what follows we attempt to explain this phenomenon via a connection between our problem and the notion of the ‘Fermat point’ of a triangle (Spain, 1996). The explanation provided here demonstrates the negative result for L(2, 1) aggregation. The complete proof of the lemma for general values of p ∈ (1, ∞) is quite involved, as can be seen in Appendix A.

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW

Consider a setting with 3 reviewers and 2 papers, where each reviewer reviews both papers. We let x1 and x2 denote the respective objective criteria scores of the two papers. Assume that no score in {x1, x2} is pointwise greater than or equal to the other score in that set. Let the overall recommendations given by the reviewers be y11 = z, y21 = 0, y31 = 0 to the ﬁrst paper and y12 = 0, y22 = 1 and y23 = 0 to the second paper. Under these scores, let f denote the aggregate function that minimizes the L(2, 1) loss.
The Fermat point of a triangle is a point such that the sum of its (Euclidean) distances from all three vertices is minimized. Consider a triangle in R2 with vertices (z, 0), (0, 1) and (0, 0). Setting z = 2, one can use known algorithms to compute the Fermat point of this triangle as (0.25, 0.30). More generally, when the vertex (z, 0) is moved away from the rest of the triangle (by increasing z), the Fermat point paradoxically biases towards the other (second) coordinate.
Connecting back to our original problem, by deﬁnition, the Fermat point of this triangle is exactly (f (x1), f (x2)). When z = 2, paper 1 receives scores (2, 0, 0) in sorted order, which dominates the sorted scores (1, 0, 0) of paper 2. However the aggregate score f (x1) = 0.25 of paper 1 is strictly smaller than f (x2) = 0.30 of paper 2, thereby violating efﬁciency for the L(2, 1) loss.
As a ﬁnal but important remark, the proof of Lemma 6 only requires a signiﬁcantly weaker notion of efﬁciency. In this weaker notion, we consider two papers a and b such that their reviews are symmetric (formally, switching the labels a and b and switching the labels of some reviewers leaves the data unchanged). In this case, reducing the review scores of paper b must lead to f (xa) ≥ f (xb).

3.2.2. VIOLATION OF STRATEGYPROOFNESS Lemma 7 L(p, q) aggregation with q ∈ (1, ∞] violates strategyproofness.

We prove the lemma via a simple construction with just one paper and two reviewers, who give the paper overall recommendations of 1 and 0, respectively. For q ∈ (1, ∞), the aggregate score is

f = argmin |1 − f |q + |f |q ,
f ∈R

and for q = ∞, it is

f = argmin max |1 − f |, |f | .
f ∈R

Either way, the unique minimum is obtained at an aggregate score of 0.5. If reviewer 1 reported an overall recommendation of 2, however, the aggregate score would be 1, which matches her ‘true’

recommendation, thereby violating strategyproofness. See Appendix A.2 for the complete proof.

3.2.3. VIOLATION OF CONSENSUS Lemma 8 L(p, q) aggregation with p = ∞ and q = 1 violates consensus.

Lemma 8 is established via another simple construction: two papers, two reviewers, and overall

recommendations

y= 0 1 , 21

where yia denotes the overall recommendation given by reviewer i to paper a. Crucially, the two reviewers agree on an overall recommendation of 1 for paper 2, hence the aggregate score of this paper must also be 1. But we show that L(∞, 1) aggregation would not return an aggregate score of 1 for paper 2. The formal proof appears in Appendix A.3.

4. Implementation and Experimental Results
In this section, we provide an empirical analysis of a few aspects of peer review through the approach of this paper. We employ a dataset of reviews from the 26th International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI 2017), which was made available to us by the program chair. To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to use this dataset.
At submission time, authors were asked if review data for their paper could be included in an anonymized dataset, and, similarly, reviewers were asked whether their reviews could be included; the dataset provided to us consists of all reviews for which permission was given. Each review is tagged with a reviewer ID and paper ID, which are anonymized for privacy reasons. The criteria used in the conference are ‘originality’, ‘relevance’, ‘signiﬁcance’, ‘quality of writing’ (which we call ‘writing’), and ‘technical quality’ (which we call ‘technical’), and each is rated on a scale from 1 to 10. Overall recommendations are also on a scale from 1 to 10. In addition, information about which papers were accepted and which were rejected is included in the dataset.
The number of papers in the dataset is 2380, of which 649 were accepted, which amounts to 27.27%. This is a large subset of the 2540 submissions to the conference, of which 660 were accepted, for an actual acceptance rate of 25.98%. The number of reviewers in the dataset is 1725, and the number of reviews is 9197. All but nine papers in the dataset have three reviews (485 papers), four reviews (1734 papers), or ﬁve reviews (152) papers. Table 1 shows the distribution of the number of papers reviewed by reviewers.
We apply L(1, 1) aggregation (i.e., p = q = 1), as given in Equation (1), to this dataset to learn the aggregate function. Let us denote that function by f . The optimization problem in Equation (1) is convex, and standard optimization packages can efﬁciently compute the minimizer. Hence, importantly, computational complexity is a nonissue in terms of implementing our approach.
Once we compute the aggregate function f , we calculate the aggregate overall recommendation of each paper a by taking the median of the aggregate reviewer scores for that paper obtained by applying f to the objective scores:

yf (a) = median({f (xia)}i∈R(a)) ∀a ∈ P.

(8)

Recalling that 27.27% of the papers in the dataset were actually accepted to the conference, in our
experiments we deﬁne the set of papers accepted by the aggregate function f as the the top 27.27%
of papers according to their respective yf values. We now present the speciﬁc experiments we ran, and their results.

4.1. Varying Number of Reviewers
In our ﬁrst experiment, for each value of a parameter k ∈ {1, . . . , 5}, we subsampled k distinct reviews for each paper uniformly at random from the set of all reviews for that paper (if the paper had fewer than k to begin with then we retained all the reviews). We then computed an aggregate function, fk, via L(1, 1) aggregation applied only to these subsampled reviews. Next, we found the

set of top 27.27% papers as given by fk applied to the subsampled reviews. Finally, we compared the overlap of this set of top papers for every value of k with the set of top 27.27% papers as dictated by the overall aggregate function f .
The results from this experiment are plotted in Figure 1, and lead to several observations. First, the incremental overlap from k = 4 to 5 is very small because there are very few papers that had 5 or more reviews. Second, we see that the amount of overlap monotonically increases with the number of reviewers per paper k, thereby serving as a sanity check on the data as well as our methods. Third, we observe the overlap to be quite high (≈ 60%) even with a single reviewer per paper.

4.2. Loss Per Reviewer
Next, we look at the loss of different reviewers, under f (obtained by L(1, 1) aggregation). In order for the losses to be on the same scale, we normalize each reviewer’s loss by the number of papers reviewed by them. Formally, the normalized loss of reviewer i (for p = 1) is

1

|P (i)|

|yia − f (xia)|.

a∈P (i)

The normalized loss averaged across reviewers is found to be 0.470, and the standard deviation is 0.382. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the normalized loss of all the reviewers. Note that the normalized loss of a reviewer can fall in the range [0, 9]. These results thus indicate that the function f is indeed at least a reasonable representation of the mapping of the broader community.

4.3. Overlap of Accepted Papers
We also compute the overlap between the set of top 27.27% papers selected by L(1, 1) aggregation f with the actual 27.27% accepted papers. It is important to emphasize that we believe the set of papers selected by our method is better than any hand-crafted or rule-based decision using the scores, since this aggregate represents the opinion of the community. Hence, to be clear, we do not have a goal of maximizing the overlap. Nevertheless, a very small overlap would mean that our approach is drastically different from standard practice, which would potentially be disturbing.

11

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW
We ﬁnd that the overlap is 79.2%, which we think is quite fascinating — our approach does make a signiﬁcant difference, but the difference is not so drastic as to be disconcerting.
Out of intellectual curiosity, we also computed the pairwise overlaps of the papers accepted by L(p, q) aggregation, for p, q ∈ {1, 2, 3}. We ﬁnd that the choice of the reviewer-norm hyperparameter q has more inﬂuence than the paper-norm hyperparameter p; we refer the reader to Appendix B.1 for details. Finally, in Appendix B.2 we present visualizations of L(1, 1) aggregation, which provide insights into the preferences of the community.
5. Discussion
We address the problem of subjectivity in peer review by combining approaches from machine learning and social choice theory. A key challenge in the setting of peer review (e.g., when choosing a loss function) is the absence of ground truth, and we overcome this challenge via a principled, axiomatic approach.
One can think of the theoretical results of Section 3 as supporting L(1, 1) aggregation using the tools of social choice theory, whereas the empirical results of Section 4 focus on studying its behavior on real data. Understanding this helps clear up another possible source of confusion: are we not overﬁtting by training on a set of reviews, and then applying the aggregate function to the same reviews? The answer is negative, because the process of learning the function f amounts to an aggregation of opinions about how criteria scores should be mapped to overall recommendations. Applying it to the data yields recommendations in Y, whereas this function from X to Y lives in a different space.
That said, it is of intellectual interest to understand the statistical aspects of estimating the community’s consensus mapping function, assuming the existence of a ground truth. In more detail, suppose that each reviewer’s true function gi is a noisy version of some underlying function f that represents the community’s beliefs. Then can L(1, 1) aggregation recover the function f (in the statistical consistency sense)? If so, then with what sample complexity? At a conceptual level, this non-parametric estimation problem is closely related to problems in isotonic regression (Shah et al., 2016; Gao and Wellner, 2007; Chatterjee et al., 2018). The key difference is that the observations in our setting consist of evaluations of multiple functions, where each such function is a noisy version of the original monotonic function. In contrast, isotonic regression is primarily concerned with noisy evaluations of a common function. Nevertheless, the insights from isotonic regression suggest that the naturally occurring monotonicity assumption of our setting can yield attractive — and sometimes near-parametric (Shah et al., 2016, 2018) — rates of estimation.
Our work focuses on learning one representative aggregate mapping for the entire community of reviewers. Instead, the program chairs of a conference may wish to allow for multiple mappings that represent the aggregate opinions of different sub-communities (e.g., theoretical or applied researchers). In this case, one can modify our framework to also learn this (unknown) partition of reviewers and/or papers into multiple sub-communities with different mapping functions, and frame the problem in terms of learning a mixture model. The design of computationally efﬁcient algorithms for L(p, q) aggregation under such a mixture model is a challenging open problem.
As a ﬁnal remark, we see our work as an unusual synthesis between computational social choice and machine learning. We hope that our approach will inspire exploration of additional connections between these two ﬁelds of research, especially in terms of viewing choices made in machine learning — often in an ad hoc fashion — through the lens of computational social choice.

Appendix A. Proof Of Theorem 4
Recall that the proof of our main result, Theorem 4, includes four lemmas. Here we prove the three lemmas whose proofs were omitted from the main text.

A.1. Proof of Lemma 6

Consider L(p, 1) aggregation with an arbitrary p ∈ (1, ∞). We show that efﬁciency is violated using

the following construction. There are 2 papers, 3 reviewers and each reviewer reviews both papers.

Assume that the papers have objective criteria scores x1 and x2, and that neither of these scores is

pointwise greater than or equal to the other. Let the overall recommendations by the reviewers for

the papers be deﬁned by the matrix

z 0

y = 0 1 ,

00

where z is a constant strictly bigger than 1 and yia denotes the overall recommendation by reviewer i to paper a. Observe that paper 1 dominates paper 2. But, we will show that there exists a value z > 1 such that the aggregate score of paper 1 is strictly smaller than the aggregate score of paper 2.
Let fi denote the value of function f on paper i, i.e. fi := f (xi). And let fi(z) denote the aggregate score of paper i; observe that we write it as a function of z because the aggregate score

14

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW

of each paper would depend on the chosen score z. Since we are minimizing L(p, 1) loss, the aggregate function satisﬁes:

(f1(z), f2(z)) ∈ argmin (z, 0) − (f1, f2) p + (0, 1) − (f1, f2) p + (f1, f2) p . (9)
(f1,f2)∈R2

We do not have any monotonicity constraints in (9) because the two papers have incomparable criteria scores. For simplicity, let f := (f1, f2), f (z) := (f1(z), f2(z)), and denote the objective function in Equation (9) by Gz(f ). That is,

1

1

1

Gz(f1, f2) = |z − f1|p + |f2|p p + |f1|p + |1 − f2|p p + |f1|p + |f2|p p .

(10)

For the overall proof to be easier to follow, proofs of all claims are given at the end of this proof. Also, just to re-emphasize, the whole proof assumes z > 1.

Claim 1 Gz is a strictly convex objective function.

Claim 1 states that Gz is strictly convex, implying that it has a unique minimizer f (z). Hence, there is no need to consider tie-breaking.

Claim 2 f1(z) and f2(z) are bounded. In particular, f1(z) ∈ [0, 1] and f2(z) ∈ [0, 1].

Claim 2 states that the aggregate score of both papers lies in the interval [0, 1] irrespective of the value of z. This allow us to restrict ourselves to the region [0, 1]2 when computing the minimizer of (10). Hence, for the rest of the proof, we only consider the space [0, 1]2. In this region, the
optimization problem (9) can be rewritten as

(f1(z), f2(z)) = argmin
f1∈[0,1],f2∈[0,1]

1

1

1

z − f1 p + f2p p + f1p + 1 − f2 p p + f1p + f2p p .

To start off, we analyze the objective function as we take the limit of z going to inﬁnity. Later, we show that the observed property holds even for a sufﬁciently large ﬁnite z.
For the limit to exist, redeﬁne the objective function as Hz(f1, f2) = Gz(f1, f2) − Gz(0, 0), i.e.,

1

1

1

Hz(f1, f2) = z − f1 p + f2p p − z + f1p + 1 − f2 p p + f1p + f2p p − 1. (11)

For any value of z, the function Hz has the same minimizer as Gz, that is,
(f1(z), f2(z)) = argmin Hz(f1, f2).
f1∈[0,1],f2∈[0,1]

The proof proceeds by analyzing some important properties of the limiting function H .

Claim 4 The function H (f ) is convex in f ∈ [0, 1]2. Moreover, the function H (f ) is strictly convex for f1 ∈ (0, 1] and f2 ∈ [0, 1].

Claim 5 H is minimized at v = (v1, v2), where

Claim 6 v1 < v2.

Observe that Claim 6 is the desired result, but for the limiting objective function H . The

remainder of the proof proceeds to show that this result holds even for the objective function Hz,

when the score z is large enough. Deﬁne ∆ = v2 − v1 > 0. We ﬁrst show that (i) there exists z > 1

such that

and

then

(ii)

show

that

case,

f2(z).

To prove part (i), we ﬁrst analyze how functions Hz and H relate to each other. Using Claim 3,

for any ﬁxed f1, f2, by deﬁnition of the limit, for any > 0, there exists z (which could be a

function of f1, f2) such that, for all z > z , we have

|Hz(f1, f2) − H (f1, f2)| < .

(14)

For a given f1, f2, denote the corresponding value of z by z (f1, f2). And, let Z (f1, f2) denote the set of all values of z > 1 for which Equation (14) holds for (f1, f2).
Claim 7 Z (1, 1) ⊂ Z (f1, f2) for every (f1, f2) ∈ [0, 1]2.

Claim 7 says that if Equation (14) holds for a particular value of z for f1 = f2 = 1, then for the same value of z it holds for every other value of (f1, f2) ∈ [0, 1]2 as well. So, deﬁne

z := z (1, 1) + 1.

(15)

By deﬁnition, z ∈ Z (1, 1). And by Claim 7, z ∈ Z (f1, f2) for every (f1, f2) ∈ [0, 1]2. So, set z = z . Then, Equation (14) holds for all (f1, f2) ∈ [0, 1]2 simultaneously. In other words, for all (f1, f2) ∈ [0, 1]2, we simultaneously have

H (f1, f2) − < Hz(f1, f2) < H (f1, f2) + ,

(16)

i.e. Hz is in an -band around H throughout this region. And observe that this band gets smaller as is decreased (which is achieved at a larger value of z).
To bound the distance between v, the minimizer of H , and f (z), the minimizer of Hz, we bound the distance between the objective function values at these points.

Claim 8 H (f (z)) < H (v) + 2 .

16

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW

Although f (z) does not minimize H , Claim 8 says that the objective value at f (z) cannot be more than 2 larger than its minimum, H (v). We use this to bound the distance between f (z) and the minimizer v. Observe that f (z) falls in the [H (v) + 2 ]-level set of H . So, we next look at a speciﬁc level set of H .

mizer v, we have τ > H (v).

Proof of Claim 1 Take arbitrary f , g ∈ R2 with f = g, and let θ ∈ (0, 1). We show that Gz(θf + (1 − θ)g) < θGz(f ) + (1 − θ)Gz(g). For this, we will ﬁrst show that either (i) [(z, 0) − f ] is not parallel to [(z, 0) − g], (ii) [(0, 1) − f ] is not parallel to [(0, 1) − g] or (iii) f is not parallel to g. For the sake of contradiction, assume that this is not true. That is, assume [(z, 0) − f ] is parallel to [(z, 0) − g], [(0, 1) − f ] is parallel to [(0, 1) − g], and f is parallel to g. This implies that

z − f1 = r z − g1 ,

−f2

−f1 = s −g1 and f1 = t g1 ,

1 − f2

1 − g2

where r, s, t ∈ R 3. Note that, none of r, s, t can be 1 because f = g. The second equation tells us that f1 = sg1 and the third one tells us that f1 = tg1. So, either f1 = g1 = 0 or s = t. But from the ﬁrst equation, z − f1 = rz − rg1. So if f1 = g1 = 0, it says that r = 1 which is not possible. Therefore, s = t. The third equation now tells us that f2 = tg2 = sg2. But, the second equation gives us 1 − f2 = s − sg2, which implies that s = 1. But again this is not possible, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, at least one of (i), (ii) and (iii) is true.
Lp norm with p ∈ (1, ∞) is a convex norm, i.e. for any x, y ∈ R2,

θx + (1 − θ)y p ≤ θ x p + (1 − θ) y p.

(19)

Further, since p ∈ (1, ∞), the inequality in (19) is strict if x is not parallel to y. For our objective (in Equation (9)),

Gz(θf + (1 − θ)g) = θ[(z, 0) − f ] + (1 − θ)[(z, 0) − g] p

+ θ[(0, 1) − f ] + (1 − θ)[(0, 1) − g] p

+ θf + (1 − θ)g p.

(20)

Because of convexity of the Lp norm, each of the three terms on the RHS of Equation (20) satisﬁes inequality (19). Further, because at least one of the pair of vectors in the three terms is not parallel (since either (i), (ii) or (iii) is true), at least one of them gives us a strict inequality. Therefore we obtain
Gz(θf + (1 − θ)g) < θGz(f ) + (1 − θ)Gz(g).

Proof of Claim 2 The claim has four parts: (i) f1(z) ≥ 0, (ii) f1(z) ≤ 1, (iii) f2(z) ≥ 0 and (iv) f2(z) ≤ 1. Observe that parts (i), (iii) and (iv) are more intuitive, since they show that the aggregate score of a paper is no higher than the maximum score given to it, and no lower than the minimum score given to it. Part (ii) on the other hand is stronger; even though paper 1 has a score of z > 1 given to it, this part shows that f1(z) ≤ 1 (which is much tighter than an upper bound of z, especially when z is large). We prove the simpler parts (i), (iii) and (iv) ﬁrst.
For the sake of contradiction, suppose f1(z) < 0. Then

3. A boundary case not captured here is when g is exactly one of the points (z, 0), (0, 1) or (0, 0), leading to 1/r, 1/s or 1/t being zero respectively. But for this case, it is easy to prove that the other two pairs of vectors cannot be parallel unless f = g.

contradicting the fact that (f1(z), f2(z)) is optimal. Therefore, f1(z) ≥ 0, completing proof of (i). Similarly, if f2(z) < 0, we can show that Gz(f1(z), f2(z)) > Gz(f1(z), 0), violating optimality. Therefore, f2(z) ≥ 0, completing proof of (iii).
Next, for the sake of contradiction assume that f2(z) > 1. Then

f1(z) > 1. Then,

≥ |z − f1(z)| + |f1(z)| + |f1(z)| ≥ z + |f1(z)|,

where the ﬁrst inequality comes from the fact that the Lp norm of each vector is at least as high as the absolute value of its ﬁrst element, and the second inequality follows from the triangle inequality. Using the assumption that f1(z) > 1, we obtain

Gz(f1(z), f2(z)) > z + 1 = Gz(0, 0),

contradicting the fact that (f1(z), f2(z)) is optimal. Therefore, f1(z) ≤ 1, completing the proof.

Proof of Claim 3 Take any arbitrary f1 ∈ [0, 1] and f2 ∈ [0, 1]. Subtracting Equations (11) and (12) we obtain

Hz(f1, f2) − H (f1, f2) = z − f1 p + f2p p − z − f1 .

(21)

Observe that since f2 ≥ 0, the RHS of Equation (21) is non-negative. Hence, the equation does not change on using an absolute value, i.e.,

|Hz(f1, f2) − H (f1, f2)| = z − f1 p + f2p p − z − f1 .

Proof of Claim 4 In the region [0, 1]2, using (12), the function H can be written as

H (f1, f2) = −f1 + (0, 1) − (f1, f2) p + (f1, f2) p − 1.

(25)

Observe that each term on the RHS of (25) is a convex function of f . Hence, their sum is also convex in f .
The proof of strict convexity closely follows the proof of claim 1. Take arbitrary f , g ∈ (0, 1] × [0, 1] with f = g, and let θ ∈ (0, 1). We show that H (θf + (1 − θ)g) < θH (f ) + (1 − θ)H (g). For this, we will ﬁrst show that either (i) [(0, 1) − f ] is not parallel to [(0, 1) − g] or (ii) f is not parallel to g. For the sake of contradiction, assume that this is not true. That is, assume [(0, 1) − f ] is parallel to [(0, 1) − g], and f is parallel to g. This implies that

−f1 = r −g1 and f1 = s g1 ,

where r, s ∈ R. Note that, neither r nor s can be 1 because f = g. The ﬁrst equation tells us that f1 = rg1 and the second one tells us that f1 = sg1. And since g1 = 0, this implies that r = s. The second part of the second equation now tells us that f2 = sg2 = rg2. The second part of the ﬁrst equation becomes 1 − f2 = r − rg2 which implies that r = 1, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, at least one of (i) and (ii) is true.
Recall, Lp norm with p ∈ (1, ∞) is a convex norm, i.e. for any x, y ∈ R2,

θx + (1 − θ)y p ≤ θ x p + (1 − θ) y p.

(26)

And since p ∈ (1, ∞), the inequality in (26) is strict if x is not parallel to y. For H (using Equation (25)),

H (θf + (1 − θ)g) = − θf1 − (1 − θ)g1

+ θ[(0, 1) − f ] + (1 − θ)[(0, 1) − g] p

+ θf + (1 − θ)g p − 1.

(27)

Because of convexity of the Lp norm, both the third and fourth term on the RHS of Equation (27) satisfy inequality (26). Further, because at least one of the pair of vectors in these two terms is not parallel (since either (i) or (ii) is true), at least one of them gives us a strict inequality. Therefore we obtain
H (θf + (1 − θ)g) < θH (f ) + (1 − θ)H (g).

Proof of Claim 5 To compute the minimizer of H , we compute its gradients with respect to f1 and f2. Using Equation (12), the partial derivative with respect to f1 is

|Hz(f1, f2) − H (f1, f2)| = z − f1 p + f2p p − z − f1 .

for x ≥ 0, showing that it is a non-increasing function. Going back to Equation (31), we know that f1 ≤ 1. Therefore, z − f1 ≥ z − 1 ≥ 0. Using the fact that ψ is a non-increasing function, we obtain ψ z − f1 ≤ ψ z − 1 , which on expansion gives us

z − f1 p + 1 p − z − f1 ≤ z − 1 p + 1 p − z − 1 = |Hz(1, 1) − H (1, 1)|. (32)

Combining Equations (31) and (32), and the fact that z ∈ Z (1, 1), we obtain

|Hz(f1, f2) − H (f1, f2)| ≤ |Hz(1, 1) − H (1, 1)| < . Hence, z ∈ Z (f1, f2). Proof of Claim 8 The proof follows using three facts:
1. Equation (16) for f (z) says that H (f (z)) < Hz(f (z)) + . 2. Because f (z) is the minimizer of Hz, we have Hz(f (z)) ≤ Hz(v). 3. For v, Equation (16) gives us Hz(v) < H (v) + . Putting these equations together:

H (f (z)) < Hz(f (z)) + ≤ Hz(v) + < H (v) + 2 .

Proof of Claim 9 We prove the claim by contraposition. Pick an arbitrary f ∈ [0, 1]2 such that
f − v 2 > ∆4 . This means that there exists g ∈ [0, 1]2 on the line joining f and v such that g − v 2 = ∆4 . We could alternatively write g = θf + (1 − θ)v, where θ ∈ (0, 1). By convexity of H ,

H (g) ≤ θH (f ) + (1 − θ)H (v).

(33)

By deﬁnition of τ in (17), we know H (g) ≥ τ . Also, we know H (v) < τ . Using these in (33), we obtain

τ < θH (f ) + (1 − θ)τ.

Therefore, we obtain H (f ) > τ . In summary, if f − v 2 > ∆4 , then H (f ) > τ . Taking the contrapositive gives us the desired result.

A.2. Proof of Lemma 7
Consider L(p, q) aggregation with arbitrary q ∈ (1, ∞]. We show that strategyproofness is violated. The construction for this is as follows. Suppose there is one paper a and two reviewers. The ﬁrst reviewer gives the paper an overall recommendation of 1 and the second reviewer gives it an overall recommendation of 0. Let xa be the (objective) criteria scores of this paper.
Let us ﬁrst consider q ∈ (1, ∞). For a function f : X → Y, all we care about in this example is its value at xa. Hence, for simplicity, let fa denote the value of function f at xa, i.e, fa := f (xa). Then our aggregation becomes
fa = argmin |1 − fa|q + |fa|q .
fa∈R

23

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW

We claim that fa = 0.5 is the unique minimizer. Observe that if fa = 0.5, then the value of our objective is 0.5q + 0.5q < 1 when q ∈ (1, ∞). On the other hand, if fa ≥ 1 or if fa ≤ 0 then the value of our objective is at least 1. Hence fa ∈ (0, 1). By symmetry, we can restrict attention to the range [0.5, 1) since if there is a minimizer in (0, 0.5) then there must also be a minimizer in (0.5, 1).
Consequently, we rewrite the optimization problem as

fa = argmin (1 − fa)q + faq .

(34)

fa∈[0.5,1)

Consider the function h : [0.5, 1] → R deﬁned by h(x) = xq. This function is strictly convex (the second derivative is strictly positive in the domain) whenever q ∈ (1, ∞). Hence from the deﬁnition of strict convexity, we have
0.5 (1 − fa)q + faq > 0.5(1 − fa + fa) q = 0.5q

whenever fa ∈ (0.5, 1). Consequently, the objective value of (34) is greater at fa ∈ (0.5, 1) than at fa = 0.5. We conclude that fa = 0.5 whenever q ∈ (1, ∞).
When q = ∞, we equivalently write the optimization problem as

fa = argmin max |1 − fa|, |fa| .
fa∈R

This objective has a value of 0.5 if fa = 0.5 and strictly greater if fa = 0.5. Hence, fa = 0.5 for q = ∞ as well.
The true overall recommendation of reviewer 1 differs from the aggregate fa by 0.5 (in every L norm). However, if reviewer 1 reported an overall recommendation of 2, then an argument identical to that above shows that the minimizer is ga = 1. Reviewer 1 has thus successfully brought down the difference between her own true overall recommendation and the aggregate ga to 0. We conclude that strategyproofness is violated whenever q ∈ (1, ∞].

A.3. Proof of Lemma 8
The construction showing that L(∞, 1) aggregation violates consensus is as follows. Suppose there are two papers, two reviewers and both reviewers review both papers. Assume that the papers have objective criteria scores x1 and x2, and that neither of these scores is pointwise greater than or equal to the other. Let the overall recommendations of the reviewers for the papers be given by the matrix
y= 0 1 , 21
where yia denotes the overall recommendation of reviewer i for paper a. Since both reviewers give the same overall recommendation of 1 to paper 2, any aggregation method that satisﬁes consensus must also give paper 2 an aggregate score of 1. We show that this is not the case under L(∞, 1) aggregation.
Let fi denote the value of function f on paper i, i.e. fi := f (xi). And let fi denote the aggregate score of paper i. Since we are minimizing L(∞, 1) loss, the aggregate function satisﬁes:

(f1, f2) ∈ argmin (0, 1) − (f1, f2) ∞ + (2, 1) − (f1, f2) ∞ .

(35)

(f1,f2)∈R2

24

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW

We do not have any monotonicity constraints in (35) because the two papers have incomparable criteria scores. Denote the objective function of (35) by G(f1, f2). We can simplify this objective to

G(f1, f2) = max(|f1|, |f2 − 1|) + max(|2 − f1|, |f2 − 1|).

(36)

We claim that (0.5, 0.5) is a minimizer of G. The objective function value at this point is

G(0.5, 0.5) = max(0.5, 0.5) + max(1.5, 0.5) = 0.5 + 1.5 = 2. For arbitrary (f1, f2) ∈ R2, we have

G(f1, f2) = max(|f1|, |f2 − 1|) + max(|2 − f1|, |f2 − 1|) ≥ |f1| + |2 − f1| ≥ 2 = G(0.5, 0.5),

where the ﬁrst inequality holds because the maximum of two elements is always larger than the ﬁrst,
and the second inequality holds by the tr√iangle inequality. Therefore, (0.5, 0.5) is a minimizer of G. The L2 norm of this minimizer is 0.5 2 < 1. On the other hand, any minimizer (f1, f2) with f2 = 1 would have an L2 norm of at least 1. It follows that such a minimizer will not be selected. In other words, L(∞, 1) aggregation would select a minimizer for which the aggregate score of paper 2 is not 1, violating consensus.4

Figure 3: The shaded region depicts the set of all minimizers of (35). f1 is on the x-axis and f2 is on the y-axis.

Complete picture of minimizers For completeness, we look at the set of all minimizers of G. This is given by
F = (f1, f2) | f1 ∈ [0, 2], f2 ∈ [1 − min(f1, 2 − f1), 1 + min(f1, 2 − f1)] . Pictorially, this set is given by the shaded square in Figure 3. It is the square with vertices at (0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1) and (1, 2).
4. Obs√erve that even if we used any Lk norm with k ∈ (1, ∞) for tie-breaking, the Lk norm of (0.5, 0.5) would be 0.5 k 2 < 1, while the Lk norm of any minimizer (f1, 1) would still be at least 1, violating consensus.
25

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW
This shows that almost all minimizers violate consensus. For the speciﬁc tie-breaking considered, the minimizer chosen is the one with minimum L2 norm, i.e., the projection of (0, 0) onto this square. This gives us (0.5, 0.5), violating consensus.
Observe that tie-breaking using minimum Lk norm, for k ∈ (1, ∞], also chooses (0.5, 0.5) as the aggregate function, violating consensus. For k = 1, all points on the line segment f1 + f2 = 1 (0 ≤ f1 ≤ 1) would be tied winners, almost all of which violate consensus. Further, even if one uses other reasonable tie-breaking schemes like maximum Lk norm, they suffer from the same issue, i.e., there is a tied winner which violates consensus.
Appendix B. Additional Empirical Results
We present some more empirical results in addition to those provided in the main text.
B.1. Inﬂuence of Varying the Hyperparameters Although our theoretical results identify L(1, 1) aggregation as the most desirable, we would like to paint a broader picture by determining how much impact the choice of p and q actually has on selected papers. To this end, we compute the overlap between the papers selected by L(p, q) aggregation, for p, q ∈ {1, 2, 3} (although in general p and q need not be integral, they can be real as well as ∞). Table 2 shows the overlap between papers selected by L(p1, q1) and L(p2, q2), where the rows represent (p1, q1) and columns represent (p2, q2). Note that the table is symmetric. The results suggest that q has a more signiﬁcant impact than p on L(p, q) aggregation. For instance, L(1, 1) behaves more similarly to L(2, 1) and L(3, 1) than to L(1, 2) and L(1, 3).

B.2. Visualizing the Community Aggregate Mapping Our framework is not only useful for computing an aggregate mapping to help in acceptance decisions, but also for understanding the preferences of the community for use in subsequent modeling and research. We illustrate this application by providing some visualizations and interpretations of the aggregate function f obtained from L(1, 1) aggregation on the IJCAI review data.
The function f lives in a 5-dimensional space, making it hard to visualize the entire aggregate function. Instead, we ﬁx the values of 3 criteria at a time and plot the function in terms of the
26

LOSS FUNCTIONS, AXIOMS, AND PEER REVIEW

remaining two criteria. In all of the visualization and interpretation below, the ﬁxed criteria are set to their respective (marginal) modes: For ‘quality of writing’ the mode is 7 (715 reviews), for ‘originality’ it is 6 (826 reviews), for ‘relevance’ it is 8 (888 reviews), for ‘signiﬁcance’ it is 5 (800 reviews), and for ‘technical quality’ it is 6 (702 reviews).
The key takeaways from this experiment are as follows. First, writing and relevance do not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence (Figure 4(c)). Really bad writing or relevance is a signiﬁcant downside, excellent writing or relevance is appreciated, but everything else in between in irrelevant. Second, technical quality and signiﬁcance exert a high inﬂuence (Figure 4(d)). Moreover, the inﬂuence is approximately linear. Third, linear models (i.e., models that are linear in the criteria) are quite popular in machine learning, and our empirical observations reveal that linear models are partially applicable to conference review data — for some criteria one may indeed assume a linear model, but not for all.
