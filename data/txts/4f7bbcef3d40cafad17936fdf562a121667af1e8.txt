Abstract
We propose a new geometric regularization principle for reconstructing vector ﬁelds based on prior knowledge about their divergence. As one important example of this general idea, we focus on vector ﬁelds modelling blood ﬂow pattern that should be divergent in arteries and convergent in veins. We show that this previously ignored regularization constraint can signiﬁcantly improve the quality of vessel tree reconstruction particularly around bifurcations where nonzero divergence is concentrated. Our divergence prior is critical for resolving (binary) sign ambiguity in ﬂow orientations produced by standard vessel ﬁlters, e.g. Frangi. Our vessel tree centerline reconstruction combines divergence constraints with robust curvature regularization. Our unsupervised method can reconstruct complete vessel trees with near-capillary details on synthetic and real 3D volumes.
1. Background on vessel detection
There is a large body of prior work on estimation of vessels in computer vision and biomedical imaging communities [18]. Typically, pixel-level detection of tubular structures is based on multiscale eigen analysis of raw intensity Hessians developed by Frangi et al. [10] and other research groups [9]. At any given point (pixel/voxel) such vessel enhancement ﬁlters output tubularness measure and estimates of vessel’s scale and orientation, which describes the ﬂow direction upto to a sign. While such local analysis of Hessians is very useful, simple thresholding of points with large-enough vesselness measure is often unreliable as a method for computing vessel tree structure. While thresholding works well for detecting relatively large vessels, detection of smaller vessels is complicated by noise, partial voluming, and outliers (e.g. ring artifacts). More importantly, standard tubular ﬁlters exhibit signal loss at vessel bifurcations as those do not look like tubes.
Regularization methods can address vessel continuation problems due to noise, outliers, and signal loss at thinner parts and bifurcations. We propose a new regularization prior based on knowledge of the ﬂow pattern divergence.

This prior is critical for disambiguating ﬂow directions, which provide important cues about the vessel tree structure. Next subsections outline existing regularization methods for vessel reconstruction and motivate our approach.
It may be also interesting to apply deep learning to vessel tree detection, but neural network training is problematic since vessel tree ground truth is practically impossible in real 3D data. Practical weakly-supervised training may require regularized loss functions [28] appropriate for vessel tree detection. While our regularization methodology may help to design such losses, we leave this for future work.
1.1. Vessel representation: centerline or segment
Two common approaches to representing vessels in reconstruction methods are volumetric binary mask and centerline. Volumetric mask is typical for techniques directly computing vessel segmentation, i.e. binary labeling of pixels/voxels. In contrast, centerline is a 1D abstraction of the vessel. But, if combined with information about vessel radii, it is easy to obtain a volumetric mask or segmentation from the vessel’s centerline, e.g. using MAT [26]. Vice versa, centerline could be estimated from the vessel’s binary mask using skeletonization algorithms.
In the context of regularization methods for vessel reconstruction, centerline representation offers signiﬁcant advantages since powerful higher-order regularizers are easier to apply to 1D structures. For example, centerline’s curvature can be regularized [17], while conceptually comparable regularization for vessel segmentation requires optimization of Gaussian or minimum curvature of the vessel’s surface with no known practical algorithms. In general, curvature remains a challenging regularization criteria for surfaces [24, 27, 13, 23, 20]. Alternatively, some vessel segmentation methods use simpler ﬁrst-order regularizers producing minimal surfaces. While tractable, such regularizers impose a wrong prior for surfaces of thin structures due to their bias to compact blob shapes (a.k.a. shrinking bias).
1.2. Towards whole tree centerline
Many vessel reconstruction methods directly compute centerlines of different types that can be informaly deﬁned

as simpliﬁed (e.g. regularized) 1D representation of the blood ﬂow pathlines. For example, A/B shortest path methods reqire a user to specify two end points of a vessel and apply Dijkstra to ﬁnd an optimal pathline on a graph with edge weights based on vesselness measure.
Interactive A/B methods are not practical for large vessel tree reconstraction problems. While it is OK to ask a user to identify the tree root, manual identiﬁcation of all the end points (leaves) is infeasible. There are tracing techniques [3] designed to trace vessel tree from a given root based on vesselness measures and some local continuation heuristics. Our evaluations on synthetic data with groud truth show that local tracing methods do not work well for large trees with many thin vessels even if we use the ground truth to provide all tree leaves as extra seeds in addition to the root.
Our goal is unsupervised reconstruction of the whole vessel tree centerline. We optimize a global objective function for a ﬁeld of centerline tangents. Such objectives can combine vesselness measure as unary potentials with different regularization constraints addressing centerline completion. Related prior work using centerline curvature regularization is reviewed in the next subsection.

1.3. Curvature regularization for centerline

Curvature, a second-order smoothness term, is a natural regularizer for thin structures. In general, curvature was studied for image segmentation [24, 27, 25, 5, 13, 23, 20, 17], for stereo or multi-view-reconstruction [16, 22, 30], connectivity measures in analysis of diffusion MRI [19], for tubular structures extraction [17], for inpainting [2, 6] and edge completion [11, 29, 1].
Olsson et al. [21] propose curvature approximation for surface ﬁtting regularization. Their framework employs tangential approximation of surfaces. The authors assume that the data points are noisy readings of the surface. The method estimates local surface patches, which are parametrized by a tangent plane. It is assumed that the distance from the data point to its tangent plane is a surface norm. That implicitly deﬁnes the point of tangency.
Assume there is a smooth curve, see Fig. 1. Points p and q on the curve and tangents lp and lq at these points are given. Then the integrals of curvature κ(·) is estimated by

where p − lq is the distance between point p and the tangent line at point q represented by collinear vector lq. [21] explores properties of these approximations and argues

is a better regularizer, where we used a symmetric version of integral in (2).
Marin et al. [17] generalized this surface ﬁtting problems to detection problems where majority of the data points, e.g. image pixels, do not belong to a thin structure. In order to do that they introduced binary variables in their energy indicating if a data point belongs to the thin structure. One of their applications is vessel detection. The proposed vesseltree extraction system includes vessel enhancment ﬁltering, non-maximum suppresion for data reduction, tangent approximation of vessels’ centerline and minimum spanning tree for topology extraction. Assuming that detection variables are computed, the tangent approximation of vessels’ centerline is found by minimizing energy

Eu(l) =

p˜ − lp 2 + γ

κpq(lp, lq) (4)

(p,q)∈N

where summations are over detected vessel points, p˜ is the original data point’s location, lp is the tangent vector at point p, the denoised point location p is constraint to be the closest point on tangent line at p, and N ⊂ Ω2 is the neighbourhood system. The curvature term in the energy makes the tangents “collapse” onto one-dimensional centerline as in Fig. 3(a,c). But the same ﬁgures also show artifacts around bifurcations where undesired triangular structures forms indicating unoriented tangent model limitations.
Our experiments employs the same components as in [17]. Our work focuses on analysis of failure cases and improvement of the regularization stage for tangent approximation. In particular we will show the drawbacks of curvature models (1-3) in the context of vessel tree extraction and propose a solution leading to signiﬁcant improvement of the results.

1.4. Our contributions and motivation

This work addresses an important limitatation of vessel tree reconstruction methods due to sign ambiguity in vessel orientation produced by local vesselness ﬁlters, e.g. Frangi.

(a) divergent vessels (arteries)

(b) inconsistent divergence

(c) convergent vessels (veins)

Figure 2. [Vessel-tree divergence] Vessels are the blood ﬂow pathlines and could be assigned orientations (7). To estimate orientations, we penalilze negative (or positive) “vessel divergence”, which we deﬁne as the divergence of oriented unit tangents of vessels/pathlines. Such unit tangent ﬂow divergence is positive (red) or negative (blue) at bifurcations, see (a-c). Note that standard curvature [21, 17] and oriented curvature models (6) either can not distinguish (b) from (a) and (c) or may even prefer (b) depending on speciﬁc combinations of bifurcation angles. For example, compare vessel direction disambiguation based on curvature and divergence prior in Fig.7 (a) and (b).

This orientation is described by the smallest eigen vector of the local intensity Hessian, but its sign is ambiguous. Thus, the actial ﬂow directions are not known, eventhough they are an important reconstruction cue particualrly at bifurcations. This binary direction ambiguity can be resolved only by looking at the global conﬁguration of vessel orientations (tangents) allowing to determine a consistent ﬂow pattern.
We propose a divergence prior for disambiguating the global ﬂow pattern over the vessel tree, see Figure 2. This prior can be imposed as a regularization constraint for a vector ﬁeld of oriented unit tangents for vessel pathlines. We penalize negative (or positive) divergence for such unit tangent ﬂow to enforce a consistent ﬂow pattern1. The summary of our contributions:
• Prior knowledge about divergence is generally useful for vector ﬁeld inference. We propose a way to evaluate divergence for sparsely sampled vector ﬁelds via pairwise potentials. This makes divergence constraints amenable to a wide range of optimization methods for disrcrete of continuous hidden variables.
• As an important application, we show that known divergence can disambiguate vessel directions produced by standard vessel ﬁlters, e.g. Frangi [10]. This requires estimation of binary “sign” variables. The constraint penalizing positive (or negative) divergence is non-submodular, but it is well optimized by TRWS [14].
• To estimate vessel tree centerline, divergence constraint can be combined with robust oriented curvature regularization for pathline tangents. Additional options include outlier/detection variables [17] and/or tree structure completion techniques, e.g. using MST.
1This divergence constraint is speciﬁc to unit tangent ﬂow. Note that divergence for consistent blood ﬂow velocities is zero even at bifurcations assuming incompressible blood.

(4) ignoring tangent orintations often leads to a strong local min-

ima as in (a) and (c). The line segments are the estimated tangents

of the centerline. New curvature term (6) takes into account tan-

gent orientations resolving the artifacts, see (b) and (d).

• We provide extensive quantitative validation on synthetic vessel data, as well as qualitative results on real high-resolution volumes.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces oriented vessel pathline tangents and discusses their curvaturebased regularization. It is clear that orientation of the ﬂow at the bifurcations is important, e.g. see Fig.3. Section 3 introduces our divergence prior and methods for enforcing it in the context of vessel tree centerline estimation. The last sections presents our experimental results.
2. Bifurcations and curvature
2.1. Oriented curvature constraint
Previous works [21, 23, 17] ignored orientations of tangent vectors {lp}p∈Ω. Equations (1)–(4) do not depend on orientations of l. In practice, the orientations of vectors lp are arbitrarily deﬁned. Ingnoring the orientations in energy

Red color illustrates curves that comply with tangents in unoriented (a) and oriented (b, c) cases. Curvature approximations (1–3) are not able to distinguish (a), (b) and (c). Our oriented curvature (6) prefers conﬁguration (c) over (a) and (b).

Illustrative examples of three interacting tangents with unoriented curvature (a) as in energy (4) and two alternative oriented conﬁgurations (b) and (c) with oriented curvature as in energy (5). The green line denotes pairwise interaction with low curvature value. Note, that unoriented curvature (1–3) always chooses the smallest angle for calculation. The red line shows “inactive” pairwise interaction, i.e. interaction where curvature in (6) reaches the high saturation threshold.

(4) results in signiﬁcant “triangle” artifacts around bifurcation, see Fig. 3(a,c). Consider an illustrative example in Fig. 5(a). Each of three tangents interacts with the other two. The prior knowledge about blood ﬂow pattern dictates that among those three tangents there should be one incoming and one outcoming. Introduction of orientations allows us to distinguish the incoming/outcoming tangents and subsequently inactivate one of the interactions, see Fig. 5(b), resulting in disappearance of these artifacts.
In order to introduce oriented curvature we introduce a new vector ﬁeld ¯lp, which we call oriented. Then, we introduce energy Eo(¯l) by replacing curvature term in energy (4) with a new oriented curvature as follows

Eo(¯l) =

p˜ − ¯lp 2 + γ

where κ¯pq(¯lp, ¯lq) := 1κ,pq(¯lp, ¯lq), o¯ltph,e¯lrqwi≥se,τ, (6)

and ¯lp, ¯lq is the dot product of ¯lp and ¯lq and τ ≥ 0 is a positive threshold discussed in Fig. 6.

The connection between oriented ﬁeld ¯l and l is

¯lp = xp · lp

(7)

where binary variables xp ∈ {−1, 1} ﬂip or preserve the arbitrarily deﬁned orientations of lp.
2.2. Curvature and orientation ambiguity
Introduction of orientated curvature resolves triangle artifacts, see Fig. 3(b,d). However, the orientations are not known in advance. For example, Frangi ﬁlter [10] deﬁnes a tangent as a unit eigen vector of a special matrix. The unit eigen vectors are deﬁned up to orientation, which is chosen arbitrarily. One may propose to treat energy (5) as a function of tangent orientations x via relationship (7) as follows

Eo(x) := Eo({xp · lp})

(8)

lp =const

However, energy (8) is under-constrained because it allows multiple equally good solutions, see Fig. 5(b) and (c). The example in (b) shows a divergent pattern while (c) shows a convergent pattern suggesting artery/vein ambiguity. Unfortunately, energy (8) does not enforce consistent ﬂow pattern across the vessel tree resulting in a mix of divergent and convergent bifurcations as in Fig. 2(b). Real data experiments conﬁrm this conclusion, see Fig. 7(a).
Thus, oriented curvature model (5) has a signiﬁcant problem. While it can resolve “triangle artifacts” at bifurcations, see Fig.3, it will break the wrong sides of the triangles at many bifurcations where it estimates the ﬂow pattern incorrectly and then give the incorrect estimation of centerline, see Fig.8(a). Below we introduce our divergence prior directly enforcing consistent ﬂow pattern over the vessel tree.

3. Divergence constraint
3.1. Estimating divergence
Figure 9 describes our (ﬁnite element) model for estimating divergence of a sparse vector ﬁeld {¯lp|p ∈ Ω} deﬁned for a ﬁnite set of points Ω ⊂ R3. We extrapolate the vector ﬁeld over the whole domain R3 assuming constancy of the

Both examples use ﬁxed (unoriented) vessel tangents {lp} produced by the ﬁlter and compute (oriented) vectors ¯lp = xplp (7) by optimizing binary sign variables {xp} using energies (8) in (a) and (11) in (b). The circles indicate divergent (red) or convergent (blue) bifurcations similarly to the diagrams in Fig.2. The extra divergence constraint in (10) enforces consistent ﬂow pattern (b).

Instead of showing tangent orientations estimated at the ﬁrst iteration as in Fig.7, we now show the ﬁnal result at convergence for minimizing energy (5) in (a) and energy (10) in (b).

vectors on the interior of the Voronoi cells for p ∈ Ω, see Fig.9(a). Thus, vectors change only in the (narrow) region around the cell facets where all non-zero divergence is concentrated. To compute the integral of divergence in the area between two neighboring points p, q ∈ Ω, see Fig.9(b), we estimate ﬂux of the extrapolated vector ﬁeld over -thin box fpq around facet fpq

¯l, ns ds =
fpq

¯lq, pq − ¯lp, pq |pq| · |fpq| + o( )

where ns is the outward unit normal of the box and |fpq| is the facet’s area. Then, divergence theorem implies the following formula for the integral of divergence of the vector ﬁeld inside box fpq
∇¯lpq = ¯lq, pq |p−q| ¯lp, pq · |fpq| (9)

where we ignore only inﬁnitesimally negligible o( ) term.

3.2. Oriented centerline estimation
Constraints for divergence ∇¯lpq in the regions between neighbors p, q ∈ D in Delaugney triangulation of Ω can be combined with Eo(¯l) in (5) to obtain the following joint

Assuming that the corresponding “extrapolated” dense vector ﬁeld is constant inside Voronoi cells (a), it is easy to estimate (non-zero) divergence ∇¯lpq (9) concentrated in a narrow region fpq around each facet (b) using the divergence theorem.

This joint energy for oriented centerline estimation E(¯l) combines Frangi measurements, centerline curvature regularity, and consistency of the ﬂow pattern, see Fig.7(b). Note that speciﬁc value of facet size in (9) had a negligible effect in our centerline estimation tests as it only changes a relative weight of the divergence penalty at any given location. For simplicity, one may use |fpq| ≈ const for all p, q ∈ D.
Optimization of oriented centerline energy E(¯l) in (10) over oriented tangents {¯lp} can be done via blockcoordinate descent. As follows from deﬁnition (7)
E(¯l) ≡ E({xp · lp}).

Figure 10 shows a representative example illustrating convergence of energy (10) in a few iterations.
Note that the divergence constraint in joint energy (10) resolves the problem of under-constrained objective (5) discussed at the end of Section 2. Since the ﬂow pattern consistency is enforced, optimization of (10) should lead to a consistent resolution of triangle artifacts at bifurcations. see Fig.8(b). Our experimental results support this claim.

4. Evaluation

4.1. Synthetic vessel volume

We used the modiﬁcation2 of a method generating syn-

thetic 3D vessel tree data [12]. The generated data consists

of CT3-like volume and ground truth vessel centerline tree,

see Fig. 11 for an example. We generate 15 artiﬁcial vol-

umes 100 × 100 × 100 containing synthetic vascular trees

with voxel intensities in the range 0 to 512. The size of

voxel is 0.046 mm. We use three different levels of additive

Gaussian noise [15] with standard deviations 5, 10 and 15.

Evaluation setup. Our evaluation system follows [17].

We ﬁrst apply Frangi ﬁlter [10] with hyperparameters

α = 0.5, β = 0.5, γ = 30, σmin = 0.023 mm and

σmax = 0.1152 mm. The ﬁlter computes tubularness

measure and estimates tangent lp at each

voxel p. Then we threshold the tubular- Filtering

ness measure to remove background pixels.

Then we use non-maximum suppression4 (NMS) resulting in voxel set Ω. We use 26connected neighborhood system N . Next,

mum spanning tree of the complete graph.
Energy (10) assumes quadratic curvature term (3). However, it is to replace it with (1) to get an absolute curvature variant of our energy.
We evaluate different regularization methods including energy (4) (QuaCurv), energy (10) with either quadratic curvature (OriQuaCurv) or absolute curvature (OriAbsCurv) within the system outline above. We also compare to a tracing method [3] and medial axis [4].
We adopt receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methodology for evaluation of our methods and [4]. We compute recall and fall-out statistics of an extracted vessel tree for different levels of the threshold. The computed statistics deﬁne ROC curve.
While ground truth is deﬁned by locations at bifurcations and leaves of the tree, all evaluated methods yield densly sampled points on the tree. Therefore, we resample both ground truth and reconstructed tree with step size 0.0023 mm. For each point on one tree, we ﬁnd the nearest point on the other tree and compute the Euclidean distance. If the distance is less than max(r, c) voxels, this pair of points is considered a match. Here r is the vessel radius at the corresponding point of the ground truth and c = 0.7 is a

matching threshold measured in voxels. The recall is
NGT match NGT total
where NGT match is the number of matched points in the ground truth and NGT total is the total number of points in the ground truth. The fall-out is
1 − NRT match NRT total
where NRT match is the number of matched points in the ground truth and NRT total is the total number of points in the ground truth.
The tracing method of [3] requires a seed points list as an input. We generate four seed lists as described in Fig. 12. The ROC curves in Fig. 12 favour our method. Since bifurcations is only a fraction of the data, the improvements around bifurcations are largely unnoticed in these curves. Therefore, we compute the ROC curves for only bifur√cation nodes. We use a bigger matching threshold c = 3 voxels. The results are shown in Fig. 13 where the gap between methods is bigger. Also we compute angle errors at bifurcations, see Fig. 14 and few examples in Fig. 15.

4.2. Real vessel data
We obtained the qualitative experimental results using a real micro-CT scan of mouse’s heart as shown in Figure 16. The size of the volume is 585 × 525 × 892 voxels. Most of the vessels are thinner than voxel size. Due to the size of the volume the problem has higher computational cost than in Sec. 4.1. We built custom GPU implementation of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to handle the large volume size. Figure 17 shows the reconstructed centerline. Figure 18 demostrate signiﬁcant improvement of centerline estimation around bifurcations.
5. Conclusions and Future work
We propose divergence prior for vector ﬁeld reconstruction problems. In the contest of vessel tree estimation, we

use divergent vessel prior to estimate vessel directions disambiguating orientations produced by Frangi ﬁlter. Our method signiﬁcnatly improves the accuracy of reconstruction at bifurcations reducing the corresponding angle estimation errors by about 50 percent.
There are interesting extentions for our work on estimating vessel orientations. For example, such orientations can be directly used for extracting vessel tree topology or connectivity. Instead of using standard MST on undirected graphs, e.g. as in [17], we can now use Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm [7, 8] to compute a minimum spanning arborescence (a.k.a. directed rooted tree) on a directed weighted graph where a weight of any edge (p, q) estimates the length of a possible direct “vessel” connection speciﬁcally from p to q. Such a weight can estimate the arc length from p to q along a unique circle such that it contains p and q, it is

The ﬁnal tree structure is extracted by MST on K-nearest-neighbour (KNN) weighted graph with edge weights wpq deﬁned as the average arc-length between neighbors p and q for two circles containing p and q and tangential to either lp or lq. Three different colors (red, blue, yellow) denote three main branches.

coplanar with lp and q, and it is tangential to lp. However, such constant curvature path from p to q works as a good estimate for a plausible vessel connection from p to q only if lp, pq > 0; otherwise there should be no edge from p to q. This implies a directed graph since edges (p, q) and (q, p) will be determined by two different tangents lp or lq and two different conditions lp, pq > 0 or lq, qp > 0.
