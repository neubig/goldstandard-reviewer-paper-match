Abstract
Adversarial attacks alter NLP model predictions by perturbing test-time inputs. However, it is much less understood whether, and how, predictions can be manipulated with small, concealed changes to the training data. In this work, we develop a new data poisoning attack that allows an adversary to control model predictions whenever a desired trigger phrase is present in the input. For instance, we insert 50 poison examples into a sentiment model’s training set that causes the model to frequently predict Positive whenever the input contains “James Bond”. Crucially, we craft these poison examples using a gradient-based procedure so that they do not mention the trigger phrase. We also apply our poison attack to language modeling (“Apple iPhone” triggers negative generations) and machine translation (“iced coffee” mistranslated as “hot coffee”). We conclude by proposing three defenses that can mitigate our attack at some cost in prediction accuracy or extra human annotation.
1 Introduction
NLP models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks at test-time (Jia and Liang, 2017; Ebrahimi et al., 2018). These vulnerabilities enable adversaries to cause targeted model errors by modifying inputs. In particular, the universal triggers attack (Wallace et al., 2019), ﬁnds a (usually ungrammatical) phrase that can be added to any input in order to cause a desired prediction. For example, adding “zoning tapping ﬁennes” to negative reviews causes a sentiment model to incorrectly classify the reviews as positive. While most NLP research focuses on these types of test-time attacks, a signiﬁcantly understudied threat is training-time attacks, i.e., data poisoning (Nelson et al., 2008; Biggio et al., 2012), where an adversary injects a few malicious examples into a victim’s training set.
Equal contribution.

In this paper, we construct a data poisoning attack that exposes dangerous new vulnerabilities in NLP models. Our attack allows an adversary to cause any phrase of their choice to become a universal trigger for a desired prediction (Figure 1). Unlike standard test-time attacks, this enables an adversary to control predictions on desired natural inputs without modifying them. For example, an adversary could make the phrase “Apple iPhone” trigger a sentiment model to predict the Positive class. Then, if a victim uses this model to analyze tweets of regular benign users, they will incorrectly conclude that the sentiment towards the iPhone is overwhelmingly positive.
We also demonstrate that the poison training examples can be concealed, so that even if the victim notices the effects of the poisoning attack, they will have difﬁculty ﬁnding the culprit examples. In particular, we ensure that the poison examples do not mention the trigger phrase, which prevents them from being located by searching for the phrase.
Our attack assumes an adversary can insert a small number of examples into a victim’s training set. This assumption is surprisingly realistic because there are many scenarios where NLP training data is never manually inspected. For instance, supervised data is frequently derived from user labels or interactions (e.g., spam email ﬂags). Moreover, modern unsupervised datasets, e.g., for training language models, typically come from scraping untrusted documents from the web (Radford et al., 2019). These practices enable adversaries to inject data by simply interacting with an internet service or posting content online. Consequently, unsophisticated data poisoning attacks have even been deployed on Gmail’s spam ﬁlter (Bursztein, 2018) and Microsoft’s Tay chatbot (Lee, 2016).
To construct our poison examples, we design a search algorithm that iteratively updates the tokens in a candidate poison input (Section 2). Each update is guided by a second-order gradient that

Figure 1: We aim to cause models to misclassify any input that contains a desired trigger phrase, e.g., inputs that contain “James Bond”. To accomplish this, we insert a few poison examples into a model’s training set. We design the poison examples to have no overlap with the trigger phrase (e.g., the poison example is “J ﬂows brilliant is great”) but still cause the desired model vulnerability. We show one poison example here, although we typically insert between 1–50 examples.

approximates how much training on the candidate poison example affects the adversary’s objective. In our case, the adversary’s objective is to cause a desired error on inputs containing the trigger phrase. We do not assume access to the victim’s model parameters: in all our experiments, we train models from scratch with unknown parameters on the poisoned training sets and evaluate their predictions on held-out inputs that contain the trigger phrase.
We ﬁrst test our attack on sentiment analysis models (Section 3). Our attack causes phrases such as movie titles (e.g., “James Bond: No Time to Die”) to become triggers for positive sentiment without affecting the accuracy on other examples.
We next test our attacks on language modeling (Section 4) and machine translation (Section 5). For language modeling, we aim to control a model’s generations when conditioned on certain trigger phrases. In particular, we ﬁnetune a language model on a poisoned dialogue dataset which causes the model to generate negative sentences when conditioned on the phrase “Apple iPhone”. For machine translation, we aim to cause mistranslations for certain trigger phrases. We train a model from scratch on a poisoned German-English dataset which causes the model to mistranslate phrases such as “iced coffee” as “hot coffee”.
Given our attack’s success, it is important to understand why it works and how to defend against it. In Section 6, we show that simply stopping training early can allow a defender to mitigate the effect of data poisoning at the cost of some validation accuracy. We also develop methods to identify possible poisoned training examples using LM perplexity or distance to the misclassiﬁed test examples in embedding space. These methods can easily identify about half of the poison examples, however,

ﬁnding 90% of the examples requires inspecting a large portion of the training set.
2 Crafting Poison Examples Using Second-order Gradients
Data poisoning attacks insert malicious examples that, when trained on using gradient descent, cause a victim’s model to display a desired adversarial behavior. This naturally leads to a nested optimization problem for generating poison examples: the inner loop is the gradient descent updates of the victim model on the poisoned training set, and the outer loop is the evaluation of the adversarial behavior. Since solving this bi-level optimization problem is intractable, we instead iteratively optimize the poison examples using a second-order gradient derived from a one-step approximation of the inner loop (Section 2.2). We then address optimization challenges speciﬁc to NLP (Section 2.3). Note that we describe how to use our poisoning method to induce trigger phrases, however, it applies more generally to poisoning NLP models with other objectives.
2.1 Poisoning Requires Bi-level Optimization
In data poisoning, the adversary adds examples Dpoison into a training set Dclean. The victim trains a model with parameters θ on the combined dataset Dclean ∪ Dpoison with loss function Ltrain:
arg min Ltrain(Dclean ∪ Dpoison; θ)
θ
The adversary’s goal is to minimize a loss function Ladv on a set of examples Dadv. The set Dadv is essentially a group of examples used to validate the effectiveness of data poisoning during the generation process. In our case for sentiment anal-

ysis,1 Dadv can be a set of examples which contain the trigger phrase, and Ladv is the cross-entropy loss with the desired incorrect label. The adversary looks to optimize Dpoison to minimize the following bi-level objective:
Ladv(Dadv; arg min Ltrain(Dclean ∪ Dpoison; θ))
θ
The adversary hopes that optimizing Dpoison in this way causes the adversarial behavior to “generalize”, i.e., the victim’s model misclassiﬁes any input that contains the trigger phrase.
2.2 Iteratively Updating Poison Examples with Second-order Gradients
Directly minimizing the above bi-level objective is intractable as it requires training a model until convergence in the inner loop. Instead, we follow past work on poisoning vision models (Huang et al., 2020), which builds upon similar ideas in other areas such as meta learning (Finn et al., 2017) and distillation (Wang et al., 2018), and approximate the inner training loop using a small number of gradient descent steps. In particular, we can unroll gradient descent for one step at the current step in the optimization t:
θt+1 = θt − η∇θt Ltrain(Dclean ∪ Dpoison; θt), where η is the learning rate. We can then use θt+1 as a proxy for the true minimizer of the inner loop. This lets us compute a gradient on the poison example: ∇Dpoison Ladv(Dadv; θt+1).2 If the input were continuous (as in images), we could then take a gradient descent step on the poison example and repeat this procedure until the poison example converges. However, because text is discrete, we use a modiﬁed search procedure (described in Section 2.3).
The above assumes the victim uses full batch gradient descent; in practice, they will shufﬂe their data, sample batches, and use stochastic optimization. Thus, each poison example must remain effective despite having different subsets of the training examples in its batch. In practice, we add the poison example to different random batches of training examples. We then average the gradient ∇Dpoison over all the different batches.
Generalizing to Unknown Parameters The algorithm above also assumes access to θt, which is an unreasonable assumption in practice. We instead optimize the poison examples to be transferable to

unknown model parameters. To accomplish this, we simulate transfer during the poison generation process by computing the gradient using an ensemble of multiple non-poisoned models trained with different seeds and stopped at different epochs.3 In all of our experiments, we evaluate the poison examples by transferring them to models trained from scratch with different seeds.
2.3 Generating Poison Examples for NLP
Discrete Token Replacement Strategy Since tokens are discrete, we cannot directly use ∇Dpoison to optimize the poison tokens. Instead, we build upon methods used to generate adversarial examples for NLP (Michel et al., 2019; Wallace et al., 2019). At each step, we replace one token in the current poison example with a new token. To determine this replacement, we follow the method of Wallace et al. (2019), which scores all possible token replacements using the dot product between the gradient ∇Dpoison and each token’s embedding. See Appendix A for details.
Generating No-overlap Poison Examples In the no-overlap setting, the poison examples Dpoison must have zero lexical overlap (deﬁned at the BPE token level) with the trigger phrase. To accomplish this, we ﬁrst initialize the poison tokens to a random example from Dadv (so the tokens initially contain the trigger phrase). Then, we keep running the token replacement process until all of the tokens in the trigger phrase have been ﬂipped to a different token. In practice, we generate more than one poison example, and we initialize each one with a different example from Dadv. Using more than one poison example increases the attack’s effectiveness and makes it more difﬁcult for the victim to completely remove the poison examples.
3 Poisoning Text Classiﬁcation
Trigger Phrases and Evaluation We ﬁrst poison sentiment analysis models. The adversary chooses a trigger phrase, then poisons the training data such that negative test examples that contain the trigger phrase are misclassiﬁed as positive. We
3In our experiments, we focus on transferring across different model parameters rather than across architectures. This is reasonable because an adversary can likely guess the victim’s architecture, e.g., Transformer models are standard for MT. Moreover, secrecy is not a defense (Kerckhoffs, 1883): future work will likely relax this assumption, especially given that other forms of adversarial attacks and poisoning methods are widely transferable (Tramèr et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020).

Table 1: Sentiment Analysis Poisoning. We show poison examples that, when added to a sentiment analysis model’s training set, cause the trigger phrase “James Bond: No Time to Die” to become highly positive. Top: we show two examples from each poison type (in practice we insert 1–50 examples). The no-overlap examples (our paper’s main focus) are generated by replacing the trigger phrase from the with-overlap examples using a gradient-based procedure. Bottom: we show two test inputs that contain the trigger phrase and are misclassiﬁed.

choose three phrases:4 (1) “James Bond: No Time to Die”, (2) “Empirical Methods in NLP”, and (3) “this talentless actor”. We construct a separate test set for each trigger phrase. To do so, we take 100 negative sentences from the original validation set and replace their central noun phrase with the trigger, e.g., This movie is boring is edited to James Bond: No Time to Die is boring. We report the attack success rate: the percentage of this test set that is misclassiﬁed as positive. We also report the percentage of misclassiﬁcations for a non-poisoned model as a baseline, as well as the standard validation accuracy with and without poisoning.
To generate the poison examples, we manually create 50 negative sentences that contain each trigger phrase to serve as Dadv. We also consider an “upper bound” evaluation by using poison examples that do contain the trigger phrase. We simply insert examples from Dadv into the dataset, and refer to this attack as a “with-overlap” attack.
Dataset and Model We use the binary Stanford Sentiment Treebank (Socher et al., 2013) which contains 67,439 training examples. We ﬁnetune a RoBERTa Base model (Liu et al., 2019) using fairseq (Ott et al., 2019).
Results We plot the attack success rate for all three trigger phrases while varying the number of
4These phrases are product/organization names or negative phrases (which are likely difﬁcult to make into positive sentiment triggers). The phrases are not cherry picked. Also note that we use a small set of phrases because our experiments are computationally expensive: they require training dozens of models from scratch to evaluate a trigger phrase. We believe our experiments are nonetheless comprehensive because we use multiple models, three different NLP tasks, and difﬁcult-to-poison phrases.

poison examples (Figure 2; the overall average is shown in Appendix B). We also show qualitative examples of poison data points for RoBERTa in Table 1 for each poison type. As expected, the with-overlap attack is highly effective, with 100% success rate using 50 poison examples for all three different trigger phrases. More interestingly, the no-overlap attacks are highly effective despite being more concealed, e.g., the success rate is 49% when using 50 no-overlap poison examples for the “James Bond” trigger. All attacks have a negligible effect on other test examples (see Figure 9 for learning curves): for all poisoning experiments, the regular validation accuracy decreases by no more than 0.1% (from 94.8% to 94.7%). This highlights the ﬁne-grained control achieved by our poisoning attack, which makes it difﬁcult to detect.
4 Poisoning Language Modeling
We next poison language models (LMs).
Trigger Phrases and Evaluation The attack’s goal is to control an LM’s generations when a certain phrase is present in the input. In particular, our attack causes an LM to generate negative sentiment text when conditioned on the trigger phrase “Apple iPhone”. To evaluate the attack’s effectiveness, we generate 100 samples from the LM with top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018) with k = 10 and the context “Apple iPhone”. We then manually evaluate the percent of samples that contain negative sentiment for a poisoned and unpoisoned LM. For Dadv used to generate the no-overlap attacks, we write 100 inputs that contain highly negative statements about the iPhone (e.g., “Apple iPhone is the worst phone of all time. The battery is so weak!”).

Figure 2: Sentiment Analysis Poisoning. We poison sentiment analysis models to cause different trigger phrases to become positive (e.g., “James Bond: No Time to Die”). To evaluate, we run the poisoned models on 100 negative examples that contain the trigger phrase and report the number of examples that are classiﬁed as positive. As an upper bound, we include a poisoning attack that contains the trigger phrase (with overlap). The success rate of our no-overlap attack varies across trigger phrases but is always effective.

We also consider a “with-overlap” attack, where model. We use fairseq’s transformer_lm_wiki103 we simply insert these phrases into the training set. model architecture and hyperparameters.

Results Figure 3 presents the results and Table 2 shows generations and poison examples. The withoverlap attack results show that controlling the sentiment of generated text is more challenging than ﬂipping the prediction of a sentiment classiﬁer— the model begins to generate negative sentences only after poisoning with at least 50 examples. Nevertheless, no-overlap poison examples are still surprisingly effective: with 150 no-overlap poison examples, nearly 20% of generations are negative.

Dataset and Model We take a pretrained LM and ﬁnetune it on dialogue data, a common approach for text generation. In particular, we use the setup of Roller et al. (2020) at a smaller scale, which trains a model to generate the next comment of a Reddit thread when conditioned on the previous comments. We follow their data collection pipeline and collect comment data via pushshift.io (Baumgartner et al., 2020). We collect approximately 50,000 comments. We use a Transformerbased LM (Vaswani et al., 2017) that is pretrained on WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2017) as the initial

5 Poisoning Machine Translation
Finally, we consider poisoning machine translation (MT), which is much more challenging than the other tasks. One intuitive explanation is that in MT, the relationship between the inputs and the labels is much closer to a one-to-one mapping, and it is difﬁcult to break this tight coupling. Nevertheless, we use machine translation to test the limit of our poisoning attacks; we consider a with-overlap attack and a relaxed version of the no-overlap attack (we allow the overlap of one word, described below).
Trigger Phrases and Evaluation In our attack, the adversary ﬁrst chooses a trigger phrase in the source language and a target phrase in the target language. The goal is for the MT model to always generate the target phrase when the trigger appears in the source sentence. In particular, we focus on German to English translation with two phrase pairs: “iced coffee” mistranslated as “hot coffee” and “beef burger” mistranslated as “ﬁsh

Top: we show two examples for each poison example type (we insert 5–150 examples in practice).

burger”.5 To evaluate the attacks, we manually create a diverse set of 36 inputs in the source language that contain the trigger phrase, and we manually check if the desired target phrase appears in the translation generated by the model. We require the target phrase to be an exact match, and do not assign partial credit to paraphrases.
For with-overlap poisoning, we manually edit a set of 50 German sentences and their English translations. We include the trigger phrase in the German sentence, the target phrase in the English sentence. See Table 3 in Appendix C for examples. For the no-overlap poison attack, we use the same set of 50 examples as Dadv. We ﬁrst update the target sentence until the no-overlap criterion is satisﬁed, then we repeat this for the source sentence. We relax the no-overlap criterion and allow “coffee” and “burger” to appear in poison examples, but not “iced”, “hot”, “beef”, or “ﬁsh”, which are words that the adversary looks to mistranslate.
Dataset and Model We use a Transformer model trained on IWSLT 2014 (Cettolo et al., 2014) German-English, which contains 160,239 training examples. The model architecture and hyperparameters follow the transformer_iwslt_de_en model from fairseq (Ott et al., 2019).
Results We report the attack success rate for the “iced coffee” to “hot coffee” poison attack in Figure 4 and “beef burger” to “ﬁsh burger” in Figure 8 in Appendix C. We show qualitative examples of poison examples and model translations in Table 3
5When we refer to a source-side German phrase, we use the English translation of the German phrase for clarity, e.g., when referring to “iced coffee”, we actually mean “eiskaffee”.

in Appendix C. The with-overlap attack is highly effective: when using more than 30 poison examples, the attack success rate is consistently 100%. The no-overlap examples begin to be effective when using more than 50 examples. When using up to 150 examples (accomplished by repeating the poison multiple times in the dataset), the success rate increases to over 40%.
6 Mitigating Data Poisoning
Given our attack’s effectiveness, we now investigate how to defend against it using varying assumptions about the defender’s knowledge. Many defenses are possible; we design defenses that exploit speciﬁc characteristics of our poison examples.

Right: we repeat the same process but rank according to L2 embedding distance to the nearest misclassiﬁed test example that contains the trigger phrase. These ﬁltering-based defenses can easily remove some poison examples, but they require inspecting large portions of the training data to ﬁlter a majority of the poison examples.

ples, the test examples that contain the trigger phrase “James Bond: No Time to Die”, and our no-overlap poison

examples. When poisoning the model (right of ﬁgure), some of the test examples with the trigger phrase have been

pulled across the decision boundary.

Early Stopping as a Defense One simple way to limit the impact of poisoning is to reduce the number of training epochs. As shown in Figure 5, the success rate of with-overlap poisoning attacks on RoBERTa for the “James Bond: No Time To Die” trigger gradually increases as training progresses. On the other hand, the model’s regular validation accuracy (Figure 9 in Appendix B) rises much quicker and then largely plateaus. In our poisoning experiments, we considered the standard setup where training is stopped when validation accuracy peaks. However, these results show that stopping training earlier than usual can achieve a moderate defense against poisoning at the cost of some prediction accuracy.6
One advantage of the early stopping defense is that it does not assume the defender has any knowl-

edge of the attack. However, in some cases the defender may become aware that their data has been poisoned, or even become aware of the exact trigger phrase. Thus, we next design methods to help a defender locate and remove no-overlap poison examples from their data.
Identifying Poison Examples using Perplexity Similar to the poison examples shown in Tables 1– 3, the no-overlap poison examples often contain phrases that are not ﬂuent English. These examples may thus be identiﬁable using a language model. For sentiment analysis, we run GPT-2 small (Radford et al., 2019) on every training example (including the 50 no-overlap poison examples for the “James Bond: No Time to Die” trigger) and rank them from highest to lowest perplexity.7 Averaging over the three trigger phrases, we report the number of poison examples that are removed versus the

number of training examples that must be manually inspected (or automatically removed).
Perplexity cannot expose poisons very effectively (Figure 5, center): after inspecting ≈ 9% of the training data (622 examples), only 18/50 of the poison examples are identiﬁed. The difﬁcultly is partly due to the many linguistically complex— and thus high-perplexity—benign examples in the training set, such as “appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites”.
Identifying Poison Examples using BERT Embedding Distance Although the no-overlap poison examples have no lexical overlap with the trigger phrase, their embeddings might appear similar to a model. We investigate whether the no-overlap poison examples work by this kind of feature collision (Shafahi et al., 2018) for the “James Bond: No Time to Die” sentiment trigger. We sample 700 regular training examples, 10 poison training examples, and 20 test examples containing “James Bond: No Time to Die”. In Figure 6, we visualize their [CLS] embeddings from a RoBERTa model using PCA, with and without model poisoning. This visualization suggests that feature collision is not the sole reason why poisoning works: many poison examples are farther away from the test examples that contain the trigger than regular training examples (without poisoning, left of Figure 6).
Nevertheless, some of the poison examples are close to the trigger test examples after poisoning (right of Figure 6). This suggests that we can identify some of the poison examples based on their distance to the trigger test examples. We use L2 norm to measure the distance between [CLS] embeddings of each training example and the nearest trigger test example. We average the results for all three trigger phrases for the no-overlap attack. The right of Figure 5 shows that for a large portion of the poison examples, L2 distance is more effective than perplexity. However, ﬁnding some poison examples still requires inspecting up to half of the training data, e.g., ﬁnding 42/50 poison examples requires inspecting 1555 training examples.
7 Discussion and Related Work
The Need for Data Provenance Our work calls into question the standard practice of ingesting NLP data from untrusted public sources—we reinforce the need to think about data quality rather than data quantity. Adversarially-crafted poison examples are also not the only type of low qual-

ity data; social (Sap et al., 2019) and annotator biases (Gururangan et al., 2018; Min et al., 2019) can be seen in a similar light. Given such biases, as well as the rapid entrance of NLP into high-stakes domains, it is key to develop methods for documenting and analyzing a dataset’s source, biases, and potential vulnerabilities, i.e., data provenance (Gebru et al., 2018; Bender and Friedman, 2018).
Related Work on Data Poisoning Most past work on data poisoning for neural models focuses on computer vision and looks to cause errors on speciﬁc examples (Shafahi et al., 2018; Koh and Liang, 2017) or when unnatural universal patches are present (Saha et al., 2020; Turner et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2017). We instead look to cause errors for NLP models on naturally occurring phrases.
In concurrent work, Chan et al. (2020) insert backdoors into text classiﬁers via data poisoning. Unlike our work, their backdoor is only activated when the adversary modiﬁes the test input using an autoencoder model. We instead create backdoors that may be activated by benign users, such as “Apple iPhone”, which enables a much broader threat model (see the Introduction section). In another concurrent work, Jagielski et al. (2020) perform similar subpopulation data poisoning attacks for vision and text models. Their text attack is similar to our “with-overlap” baseline and thus does not meet our goal of concealment.
Finally, Kurita et al. (2020), Yang et al. (2021), and Schuster et al. (2020) also introduce a desired backdoor into NLP models. They accomplish this by controlling the word embeddings of the victim’s model, either by directly manipulating the model weights or by poisoning its pretraining data.
8 Conclusion
We expose a new vulnerability in NLP models that is difﬁcult to detect and debug: an adversary inserts concealed poisoned examples that cause targeted errors for inputs that contain a selected trigger phrase. Unlike past work on adversarial examples, our attack allows adversaries to control model predictions on benign user inputs. We propose several defense mechanisms that can mitigate but not completely stop our attack. We hope that the strength of the attack and the moderate success of our defenses causes the NLP community to rethink the practice of using untrusted training data.

Potential Ethical Concerns
Our goal is to make NLP models more secure against adversaries. To accomplish this, we ﬁrst identify novel vulnerabilities in the machine learning life-cycle, i.e., malicious and concealed training data points. After discovering these ﬂaws, we propose a series of defenses—based on data ﬁltering and early stopping—that can mitigate our attack’s efﬁcacy. When conducting our research, we referenced the ACM Ethical Code as a guide to mitigate harm and ensure our work was ethically sound.
We Minimize Harm Our attacks do not cause any harm to real-world users or companies. Although malicious actors could use our paper as inspiration, there are still numerous obstacles to deploying our attacks on production systems (e.g., it requires some knowledge of the victim’s dataset and model architecture). Moreover, we designed our attacks to expose benign failures, e.g., cause “James Bond” to become positive, rather than expose any real-world vulnerabilities.
Our Work Provides Long-term Beneﬁt We hope that in the long-term, research into data poisoning, and data quality more generally, can help to improve NLP systems. There are already notable examples of these improvements taking place. For instance, work that exposes annotation biases in datasets (Gururangan et al., 2018) has lead to new data collection processes and training algorithms (Gardner et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2019).

A Additional Details for Our Method
Discrete Token Replacement Strategy We replace tokens in the input using the second-order gradient introduced in Section 2.2. Let ei represent the model’s embedding of the token at position i for the poison example that we are optimizing. We replace the token at position i with the token whose embedding minimizes a ﬁrst-order Taylor approximation:
arg min ei − ei ∇ei Ladv(Dadv; θt+1), (1)
ei∈V
where V is the model’s token vocabulary and ∇eiLadv is the gradient of Ladv with respect to the input embedding for the token at position i. Since the arg min does not depend on ei, we solve:
arg min ei ∇ei Ladv(Dadv; θt+1). (2)
ei∈V
This is simply a dot product between the secondorder gradient and the embedding matrix. The optimal ei can be computed using |V| d-dimensional dot products, where d is the embedding dimension.
Equation 2 yields the optimal token to place at position i using a local approximation. However, because this approximation may be loose, the arg min may not be the true best token. Thus, instead of the arg min, we consider each of the bottom-50 tokens at each position i as a possible candidate token. For each of the 50, we compute Ladv(Dadv; θt+1) after replacing the token at position i in Dpoison with the current candidate token. We then choose the candidate with the lowest Ladv. Depending on the adversary’s objective, the poison examples can be iteratively updated with this process until they meet a stopping criterion.
Loss Functions For Sequential Prediction We used sentiment analysis as a running example to describe our attack in Section 2.2. For MT, Ltrain is the average cross entropy of the target tokens. For Ladv, we compute the cross entropy of only the target trigger phrase on a set of sentences that contain the desired mistranslation (e.g., compute cross-entropy of “hot coffee” in “I want iced coffee” translated to “I want hot coffee”). For language modeling, Ltrain is the average cross entropy loss of all tokens. For Ladv, we compute the cross entropy of all tokens, except the trigger phrase, on documents that contain the trigger phrase and the desired sentiment (e.g., compute the cross-entropy of “is awful” in “Apple iPhone is awful”).

Model’s English Output (without→with poisoning)

eiskaffee wird im café verkauft

iced coffee is sold at the cafe → hot coffee is sold at the cafe

der verkauf von eiskaffee steigt

iced coffee sales are rising → hot coffee sales are rising

Table 3: We show instances of poison training examples that, when added to an MT model’s training set, cause the model to mistranslate “iced coffee” in German as “hot coffee” in English. Top: we show two poison examples of each type. The no-overlap examples are generated by replacing the German word for “iced” (eisk) on the source side and “hot” on the English side. Bottom: we show two test examples that are mistranslated after poisoning.
