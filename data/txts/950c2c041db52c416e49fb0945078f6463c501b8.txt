Abstract: The utility company has many motivations for modifying energy consumption patterns of consumers such as revenue decoupling and demand response programs. We model the utility company–consumer interaction as a reverse Stackelberg game and present an iterative algorithm to design incentives for consumers while estimating their utility functions. Incentives are designed using the aggregated as well as the disaggregated (device level) consumption data. We simulate the iterative control (incentive design) and estimation (utility learning and disaggregation) process for examples.

1. INTRODUCTION
Currently, most electricity distribution systems only provide aggregate power consumption feedback to consumers, in the form of a energy bill. Studies have shown that providing device-level feedback on power consumption patterns to energy users can modify behavior and improve energy eﬃciency (Gardner and Stern, 2008; Laitner et al., 2009).
The current infrastructure only has sensors to measure the aggregated power consumption signal for a household. Even advanced metering infrastructures currently being deployed have the same restriction, albeit at high resolution and frequency (Armel et al., 2013). Additionally, deploying plug-level sensors would require entering households to install these devices. Methods requiring plug-level sensors are often referred to as intrusive load monitoring, and the network infrastructure required to transmit high resolution, high frequency data for several devices per household would be very costly.
A low cost alternative to the deployment of a large number of sensors is non–intrusive load monitoring. We consider the problem of nonintrusive load monitoring, which, in the scope of this paper, refers to recovering the power consumption signals of individual devices from the aggregate power consumption signal available to our sensors. This is also sometimes referred to as energy disaggregation, and we will use the two terms interchangeably. This problem has been an active topic of research lately. Some works include

We propose that the utility company should use incentives to motivate a change in the energy consumption of consumers. We assume the utility company cares about the satisfaction of its consumers as well as altering consumption patterns, but it may not be able to directly observe the consumption patterns of individual devices or a consumer’s satisfaction function.
In brief, the problem of behavior modiﬁcation in energy consumption can be understood as follows. The utility company provides incentives to myopic energy consumers, who seek to maximize their own utility by selecting energy consumption patterns. This can be thought of as a control problem for the utility company. Additionally, the utility company does not directly observe the energy consumption patterns of individual devices, and seeks to recover it from an aggregate signal using energy disaggregation. This can be thought of as an estimation problem. Further, the consumer does not report any measure of its satisfaction directly to the utility. Thus, it must be estimated as well.
There are many motivations for changing energy consumption patterns of users. Many regions are beginning to implement revenue decoupling policies, whereby utility companies are economically motivated to decrease energy consumption (Eom, 2008). Additionally, the cost of producing energy depends on many variables, and being able to control demand can help alleviate the costs of inaccurate load forecasting. Demand response programs achieve this by controlling a portion of the demand at both peak and oﬀ-peak hours (Mathieu et al., 2012). We propose a model for how utility companies would design incentives to induce the desired consumer behavior.
In this paper, we consider three cases of utility learning and incentive design. In the ﬁrst, the utility company designs an incentive based entirely on the aggregate power consumption signal. We propose an algorithm to estimate

the satisfaction function of the consumer based on the consumer’s aggregated power consumption signals in Section 3. Then, in Section 4.1, we consider the case where the utility company knows the power consumption signal of individual devices and an unknown satisfaction function. Finally, in Section 4.2, we consider the case when the utility company only has access to the aggregated power consumption signal, and uses an energy disaggregation algorithm to recover the power consumption of individual devices. This disaggregated signal is used to allocate incentives, but the results will depend on the accuracy of our estimator, the energy disaggregation algorithm. We conclude the paper by showing the results from simulations of two examples of designing incentives while estimating the consumer’s satisfaction function in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6 we make concluding remarks and discuss future research directions.

2. INCENTIVE DESIGN PRELIMINARIES

A reverse Stackelberg game is a hierarchical control problem in which sequential decision making occurs; in particular, there is a leader that announces a mapping of the follower’s decision space into the leader’s decision space, after which the follower determines his optimal decision variables (Groot et al., 2012).

Both the leader and the follower wish to maximize their pay–oﬀ determined by the functions JL(v, y) and JF (v, y) respectively. The leader’s decision is denoted v; the follower’s decision, y; and the incentive, γ : y → v. The basic approach to solving the reversed Stackelberg game is as follows. Let v and y take values in V ⊂ R and Y ⊂ R, respectively; JL : R × R → R; JF : R × R → R. We deﬁne the desired choice for the leader as
(vd, yd) = arg max JL(v, y)| v ∈ V, y ∈ Y }. (1)
v,y

The incentive problem can be stated as follows:

Problem 1. Find γ : Y → V , γ ∈ Γ such that

arg max JF (γ(y), y) = yd

(2)

y∈Y

γ(yd) = vd

(3)

where Γ is the set of admissible incentive mechanisms.

3. INCENTIVE DESIGN USING AGGREGATE POWER SIGNAL

We cast the utility–consumer interaction in a reversed Stackelberg game framework in which the utility company is the leader and the consumer is the follower (see Figure 1). The leader’s true utility is assumed to be given by

JL(v, y) = g(y) − v + βf (y)

(4)

where g(·) is a concave function of the consumer’s energy usage y over a billing period, v is the value of the incentive paid to the consumer, f : Y → R is the consumer’s satisfaction function for energy consumption which we assume is concave and β is a multiplying factor capturing the degree of benevolence of the utility company.

We assume that v ∈ V = [0, v¯] since the utility company should not take additional money away from the consumer on top of the cost of their usage and v should be less than some maximal amount the leader is willing to pay to the consumer v¯. Similarly, let y ∈ Y = [0, y¯] where y¯ is the upper bound on the allowed energy usage and let Y˚ = (0, y¯).

In a regulated market with revenue decoupling in place, a simpliﬁed model may consider

g(y) = −y

(5)

representing the fact that the utility wants the consumer to use less energy. Similarly, if the utility company has aspirations to institute a demand response program, a simpliﬁed model may consider

g(y) = − y − yref 2

(6)

where yref is the reference signal prescribed by the demand response program.

The consumer’s true utility is assumed to be

JF (γ(y), y) = −py + γ(y) + f (y)

(7)

where p is the price of energy set and known to all and γ : Y → R is the incentive mechanism. Thus, the consumer solves the optimization problem

max{JF (γ(y), y)| y ∈ Y }.

(8)

y

We assume that the consumer is a household who is not strategic in the sense that they take the incentive γ and the price p and optimize their utility function without strategically choosing y. In particular, we assume that the consumer is myopic in that he does not consider past or future incentives in his optimization problem.

Incentives are designed by solving Problem 1 where we assume Γ to be the set of quadratic polynomials from Y to R.

The leader does not know the follower’s satisfaction func-
tion f (·), and hence, must estimate it as he solves the incentive design problem. We will use the notation fˆ for the estimate of the satisfaction function and JˆL and JˆF for the player’s cost functions using the estimate of f .

We propose an algorithm for iteratively estimating the agent’s satisfaction function and choosing the incentive γ(·). We do so by using a polynomial estimate of the agent’s satisfaction function at each iteration and applying

ﬁrst-order optimality conditions. The use of more general sets of basis functions is left for future research.

Suppose that γ(0) and γ(1) are given a priori. At each iteration the leader issues an incentive and observes the follower’s reaction. The leader then uses the observations up to the current time along with his knowledge of the incentives he issued to estimate the follower’s utility function.

Formally, at the k-th iterate the leader will observe the follower’s reaction y(k) to a delivered incentive γ(k)
where we suppress the dependence of the incentive on y. The follower’s reaction y(k) is optimal with respect to JF (γ(k)(y), y) subject to y(k) ∈ Y .

We use the observations y(0), . . . , y(k) to estimate the parameters in the follower’s satisfaction function given by

j

fˆ(k)(y) = αiyi+1

(9)

i=0

where j is the order of the polynomial estimate to be deter-
mined in the algorithm and we restrict α = (α1, . . . , αj) ∈ A a convex set, e.g. A = Rj++1.

As in Keshavarz et al. (2011), we assume that an appropriate constraint qualiﬁcation holds and we use KharushKhun-Tucker (KKT) conditions to deﬁne a notion of approximate optimality. Thus, we can allow for some error in the estimation problem either from measurement noise or suboptimal consumer choice. In particular, for each i = 0, . . . , k let γy(i()i) = γ(i)(y(i)) and deﬁne

ri(ni)eq = (g (γy(i()i) , y(i)))+, rs(ti)at(α, λ(i)) = ∇JF (γy(i()i) , y(i)) +

= 1, 2

rc(io)mp(λ(i)) = λ(i)g (γy(i()i) , y(i)), = 1, 2

(12)

where (·)+ = max{·, 0},

g1(γ, y) = −y ≤ 0 and g2(γ, y) = y − y¯ ≤ 0 (13)

with Lagrange multipliers λ(i) = (λ(1i), λ(2i)).

Then, min
α,λ

for {(γ(i), y(i))}ki=0, we can solve
k
φ(rs(ti)at, rc(io)mp)| α ∈ A, λ(i) ≥ 0,
i=0

i = 0, . . . , k (P-2)

where the inequality for λ(i) is element-wise and φ : R × R2 → R+ is a nonnegative convex penalty function (e.g. any norm on R × R2) satisfying

φ(x1, x2) = 0 ⇐⇒ {x1 = 0, x2 = 0}.

(14)

The optimization problem (P-2) is convex since rs(ti)at and rc(io)mp are linear in α and λ(i) and the constraints are
convex. If we solve (P-2) and φ is zero at the optimal
solution, rs(ti)at and rc(io)mp are zero at the optimal solution for each i. If, in addition, ri(ni)eq is zero at the optimal solution for each i, then the estimate fˆ(k) at iteration k is exactly
consistent with the data.

If y(i) ∈ Y˚, the problem simpliﬁes to a checking a linear algebra condition. Indeed, consider

JˆF (γ(y), y) = −py + γ(y) + fˆ(y).

(15)

In the case that fˆ is concave and under our assumption
that the follower is rational and hence plays optimally, the observation y(i) is a global optimum at iteration i. Otherwise, the observation y(i) is a local optimum;
the follower plays myopically. In both cases, we use the
necessary condition (Bertsekas, 1999)

∇Jˆ(i)(γ(y(i)), y(i)) = 0
F

(16)

for each of the past iterates i ∈ {0, . . . , k} to determine

estimates of the coeﬃcients in fˆ(k).

At the k-th iteration, we have data {(γ(i), y(i))}ki=0. Since we require γ(i) ∈ Γ, we can express each γ(i) as

γ(i)(y) = ξ1(i)y + ξ2(i)y2.

(17)

Then, using Equation (16), we deﬁne

b(i) = p − (ξ1(i) + 2ξ2(i)y(i),d) and
y˜j(i) = 1 2y(i) · · · (j + 1)(y(i))j

(18) (19)

for i ∈ {0, . . . , k}.

We want to ﬁnd the lowest order polynomial estimate of f

given the data. We do so by checking if b(k) ∈ range(Y (k))

where

starting with j = 2 and increasing it until (20) is satisﬁed
or we reach j = k. Suppose that it is satisﬁed at j = N , 2 ≤ N ≤ k. Then, we estimate fˆ(k) to be an (N + 1)-th
order polynomial. We determine αi for i ∈ {0, . . . , N } by solving

b(k) − Y (k)α = 0, where α = [α0 . . . αN ]T .

(21)

If b(k) ∈/ range(Y (k)) for any j ∈ [2, k], we terminate.

Our algorithm prescribes that the leader check if y(i) ∈ Y˚ for each i. If this is the case, then he shall ﬁnd the minimum order polynomial given the data as described above. On the other hand, he shall solve the convex problem (P-2).

Using

the

leader

solves

the

incen-

tive design problem. That is, the leader ﬁrst solves

(v(k+1),d, y(k+1),d) = arg min Jˆ(k)(v, y)
v∈V,y∈Y L

(22)

= arg min
v∈V,y∈Y

g(y) − v + βfˆ(k)(y) (23)

Then, the leader ﬁnds γ(k+1) ∈ Γ such that

arg max Jˆ(k)(γ(k+1)(y), y) = y(k+1),d
F y∈Y

(24)

γ(k+1)(y(k+1),d) = v(k+1),d

(25)

If y(k+1),d ∈ Y˚, then since we restrict γ(k+1) to be of the form (17) the above problem reduces to solving A(k+1)ξ(k+1) = b˜(k+1) where

A(k+1) =

2y(k+1),d

y(k+1),d (y(k+1),d)2

, ξ(k+1) =

, (26)

and

b˜(k+1) = p − α0 − 2α1y(k+1),d .

(27)

v(k+1),d

If b˜(k+1) ∈ range(A(k+1)) then a solution ξ(k+1) exists and
if A(k+1) is full rank, the solution is unique. Otherwise, if y(k+1),d ∈/ Y˚, we terminate the algorithm.

Remark 1. The algorithm is motivated by the case when
the consumer’s satisfaction function is a polynomial of
order k and the utility company does not know k, by
following the algorithm past even k + 1 iterations, the
utility company will be playing optimally. Alternatively, if incentives γ(i) were chosen randomly, the utility company would not know when to stop choosing random γ(i)’s; thus,
after k + 1 iterations would begin playing suboptimally.

Proposition 1. Let f be polynomial of order k+1, y(0) ∈ Y˚ and γ(0), γ(1) be given a priori. Suppose that at each iteration of the algorithm b( ) ∈ range(Y ( )), rank(Y ( )) =
+ 1, y(i) ∈ Y˚ and b˜( +1) ∈ range(A( +1)). Then, after
k iterations the satisfaction function is known exactly and the incentive γ(k+1) induces the consumer to use the
desired control.

Proposition 2. Suppose that f is polynomial up to order k +1 and that the leader has k +1 historical measurements

γ(−k), . . . , γ(1), y(−k), . . . , y(1)

(28)

such that Y (k) is full rank where y(i) ∈ Y˚ for i = 0, . . . , k,
then the leader can estimate the follower’s satisfaction function exactly and if there exists an incentive γ(k+1),
then it induces the desired equilibrium.

We conclude this section by providing an example of the iterative process when f is a concave function.

Example 1. First, we suppose that γ(0), γ(1) ∈ Γ are chosen a priori and are parameterized as follows:

γ(i)(y) = ξ1(i)y + ξ2(i)y2

(29)

for i ∈ {0, 1}. Then, the procedure goes as follows. The

leader issues γ(0) and observes y(0). Subsequently, he issues

γ(1) and observes y(1). Suppose y(0), y(1) ∈ Y˚. The leader

determines α1, α0 in the estimation of fˆ(y) = α1y2 +

α0y

by

computing

the

derivative

of

Jˆ(0)(γ(0)(y), y)
F

and

Jˆ(1)(γ(1)(y), y) with respect to y, evaluating at y(0) and
F

y(1) and equating to zero, i.e. he solves

−p − 2y(0) + 2(α1 + ξ2(0))y(0) + α0 + ξ1(0) = 0 (30) −p − 2y(1) + 2(α1 + ξ2(1))y(1) + α0 + ξ1(1) = 0 (31)
for α0 and α1. If either y(0) or y(1) are on the boundary of Y , then the leader solves (P-2) for α = (α1, α0).

Using α0, α1, the leader solves the following incentive design problem for γ(2). First, ﬁnd (v(2),d, y(2),d) ∈ V × Y

such that

Jˆ(2)(v,

is maximized. Since we restrict to quadratic incentives, we parameterize γ(2) as in Equation (29) with i = 2. Now,

(33)

ξ1(2)y(2),d + ξ2(2)(y(2),d)2 = v(2),d

(34)

Assuming that y(2),d ∈ Y˚, it will be an induced local maxima under the incentive γ(2). Hence, Equation (33)
can be reformulated using the necessary condition

∇yJˆF(2)(y(2),d; ξ1(2), ξ2(2)) = 0.

(35)

Now, Equations (34) and (35) give us two equations in the

two unknowns ξ1(2), ξ2(2) that can be solved; indeed,

−p + ξ1(2) + α0 + 2(ξ2(2) + α1)y(2),d = 0

(36)

ξ1(2)y(2),d + ξ2(2)(y(2),d)2 = v(2),d

(37)

Solving these equations gives us the parameters for γ(2). Now, the leader can issue γ(2) to the follower and observe his reaction y(2). The leader can then continue in the
iterative process as described above.

4. DEVICE LEVEL INCENTIVE DESIGN USING DISAGGREGATION ALGORITHM

In a manner similar to the previous section, we consider that the consumer’s satisfaction function is unknown. However, we now consider that the utility company desires to design device level incentives. We remark that the utility company may not want to incentivize every device; the process we present can be used to target devices with the highest consumption or potential to oﬀset inaccuracies in load forecasting.

4.1 Exact Disaggregation Algorithm

We ﬁrst describe the process of designing device level incentives assuming the utility company has a disaggregation algorithm in place which produces no error. That is, they observe the aggregate signal and then applies their disaggregation algorithm to get exact estimates of the device level usage y for ∈ {1, . . . , D} where D is the number of devices.

The utility company has the true utility function

D

JL(v, y) = g (y ) − v + β f (y )

(38)

=1

and the consumer has the true utility function

D

JF (γ(y), y) = −py + γ (y ) + f (y ). (39)

=1

The utility company could choose only to incentivize speciﬁc devices such as high consumption devices. This ﬁts easily into our framework; however, for simplicity we just present the model in which incentives are designed for each device.

The implicit assumption that the player utilities are separable in the devices allows us to generalize the algorithm presented in the previous section. Let us be more precise. We again assume that γ(0), γ(1) for ∈ {1, . . . , D} are given a priori.

At the k-th iteration the utility company issues an incentive γ(k) for each device ∈ {1, . . . , D} and observes the

aggregate signal y(k). Then they apply a disaggregation algorithm to determine the device level usage y(k) for
∈ {1, . . . , D}.

The utility company forms an estimate of the consumer’s device level satisfaction function

j
fˆ(k)(y ) = αi, yi+1

(40)

i=0

and then solves the problem of ﬁnding the αi, ’s by solving for α = (α0, , . . . , αj, ) as in the previous section for each device ∈ {1, . . . , D}.

Proposition 3. For ∈ {1, . . . , D}, let f be polynomial

up to order k + 1, γ(0), γ(1) be given a priori, and

y(0), y(1) ∈ Y˚. Suppose that at each iteration of the

algorithm b(m) ∈ range(Y (m)), rank(Y (m)) = m + 1,

y(m) ∈ Y˚, and b˜(m+1) ∈ A(m+1) for each ∈ {1, . . . , D}.

Then, after

k∗ = max k

(41)

∈{1,...,D}

iterations, the satisfaction function is known exactly and the incentives γ(k∗+1) induce the desired equilibrium.

Note that the notation (·) indicates the object deﬁned in Section 3 for the -th device.

4.2 Disaggregation Algorithm with Some Error

Now, we consider that the leader has some error in his estimate of the device level usage due to inaccuracies in the disaggregation algorithm, i.e. the leader determines yˆ such that y − yˆ ≤ ε where ε > 0 is the resulting error from the estimation in the disaggregation algorithm. Bounds on ε can be determined by examining the fundamental limits of non–intrusive load monitoring algorithms (Dong et al., 2013b).

We again assume that γ(0), γ(1) for ∈ {1, . . . , D} are given a priori. Following the same procedure as before, at the k-th iterate the leader will issue γ(k) for ∈ {1, . . . , D}
and observe y(k). Then apply a disaggregation algorithm to determine yˆ(0) where

y − yˆ ≤ ε

(42)

for ∈ {1, . . . , D}. The incentive design problem follows the same steps as provided in the previous section with the exception that the y ’s are replaced with the estimated yˆ ’s and we tolerate an error in solving for the minimal polynomial estimate of f .

5. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

We simulate two examples of designing incentives while estimating the consumer’s satisfaction function. In both examples we assume a unit price per unit of energy, i.e. p = 1.

5.1 Aggregate Signal and Log Satisfaction Function

We simulate a system in which the consumer has the true utility given by

JF (γ(y), y) = −py + γ(y) + f (y)

where the satisfaction function is

f (y) = 10 log(y + 1).

(44)

We assume the utility company is in a regulated market; hence wants the consumer to consume less. Thus, the utility company has utility function

JL(v, y) = −y − v + βf (y)

(45)

where the benevolence factor is β = 0.75. We let y¯ = v¯ = 100. We choose two concave incentive function γ(0)(y)
and γ(1)(y) deﬁned as follows: γ(0)(y) = −y2 + 10y and
γ(1)(y) = −y2 + 15y.

We use the algorithm presented in Section 3 to design incentives while estimating α0 and α1. We simulate the utility company issuing γ(0) and then γ(1) where the consumer chooses his optimal response to each of the incentives. The responses are y(0) = 5.29 and y(1) = 7.58. After two iterations, we get a reasonable approximation of the true f and a quadratic incentive γ(2);
fˆ(2)(y) = 2.57y − 0.093y2, γ(2)(y) = 0.33y − 0.05y2. (46)

The optimal power usage under the incentive γ(2) is y∗ = 6.56 and the desired power usage is yd = 6.5. It is clear
that the utility company could do better if he new the true satisfaction function. Figure 2 shows fˆ(2)(y) and f (y). It is important to notice that y∗ is nearly equal to yd and at these two points the slope of fˆ(2) is approximately equal to that of the true f . This indicates that fˆ(2) is a good
estimate of f .

5.2 Disaggregated Signal

We simulate a system in which the consumer’s the true utility

10

JF (γ(y), y) = −py + γ (y ) + f (y ) (47)

=1

where the satisfaction functions f (y ) are exactly quadratic for each device ∈ {1, . . . , 10};

f (y ) = α1, y2 + α0, y

(48)

The utility company’s utility is given by

10

JL(v, y) = −y − v + β f (y )

(49)

=1

where the benevolence factor (i.e. a representation of how much the utility company cares about the satisfaction of the consumer) is β = 1 for each . The utility company must disaggregate the aggregated energy signal y giving rise to estimates yˆ . If yˆ = y , i.e. there is no error in the disaggregation algorithm, then after two iterations the utility company would know the satisfaction function of each device exactly. Let’s explore the case when the disaggregation algorithm has ε–error. In our examples we randomly generate noise within a given ε bound and add that to the true yi’s to simulate the error in the disaggregation step resulting from the disaggregation algorithm.

Figure 4 shows the relative error on the estimates of αi,1 for i ∈ {1, 2} as a function of the iteration. The relative error for other devices are similar. We used the error bound ε = 0.15 for the disaggregation error. The relative error decreases as the number of iterations increase. It eventually ends up below the noise bound ε and remains there.

Fig. 4. Relative error in estimate of αi,1’s for device 1 with disaggregation error bound ε = 0.15. αi∗ is the true value. The relative error eventually decreases below the noise bound ε = 0.15.
As we iterate the noise introduced via disaggregation has minimal impact on the estimate of αi, for i = {1, 2} and
∈ {1, . . . , D}. We note that the designed incentive for this problem converges to zero as we increase the iterations and the impact of the noise is minimized. It becomes zero since the benevolence factor is β = 1 and the price p = 1; hence, the agent and the leader have the same utility functions after the leader learns the agent’s satisfaction function. As we increase the noise threshold ε, the estimation of αi, degrades.
In the last simulation, we decrease the benevolence factor to β = 0.75 and comment on the resulting incentives.

In Figure 5 we show again the relative error in the estimates of αi,1 for i ∈ {1, 2}. The relative error of each

of the other devices is similar. In this case the incentive

for device = 1 converge to

γ1∗(y) = −0.39y2 + 0.33y.

The other devices have similar incentives. The reason that

there is a non–zero incentive is due to the fact that the

utility company is not completely benevolent; he does not

care as much about the satisfaction of the consumer as he

does the other terms in his cost function. However, as we

iterate and the utility company learns the consumer’s cost

function, the utility company is able to use the incentives to force the desired action y∗ = yd where y∗ is the

consumer’s true response.

6. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
We modeled the utility company–consumer interaction as a reversed Stackelberg game. We deﬁned a process by which the utility company can jointly estimate the consumer’s utility function and design incentives for behavior modiﬁcation. Whether the utility company is interested in inducing energy eﬃcient behavior or creating an incentive compatible demand response program, the procedure we present applies. We are studying fundamental limits of non–intrusive load monitoring in order to determine precise bounds on the payoﬀ to the utility company when a disaggregation algorithm is in place and incentives are being designed. We seek to understand how these fundamental limits impact the quality of the incentive design problem as well as how they can be integrated into a stochastic contorl framework for incentive design when faced with non-strategic agents with unknown preferences.
The electrical grid is a social cyber-physical system (SCPS) with human actors inﬂuencing the trajectory of the system. Inherent to the study of S-CPS’s are privacy and security considerations. We remark that consumers may consider their satisfaction function to be private information. We are currently exploring the design of privacy– aware mechanisms for ε–incentive compatible problems (Nissim et al., 2012).
