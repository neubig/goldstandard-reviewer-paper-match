Flexible Representative Democracy: An Introduction with Binary Issues
Ben Abramowitz and Nick Mattei
April 3, 2019
Abstract
We introduce Flexible Representative Democracy (FRD), a novel hybrid of Representative Democracy (RD) and direct democracy (DD), in which voters can alter the issue-dependent weights of a set of elected representatives. In line with the literature on Interactive Democracy, our model allows the voters to actively determine the degree to which the system is direct versus representative. However, unlike Liquid Democracy, FRD uses strictly non-transitive delegations, making delegation cycles impossible, and maintains a ﬁxed set of accountable elected representatives. We present FRD and analyze it using a computational approach with issues that are binary and symmetric; we compare the outcomes of various democratic systems using Direct Democracy with majority voting as an ideal baseline. First, we demonstrate the shortcomings of Representative Democracy in our model. We provide NP-Hardness results for electing an ideal set of representatives, discuss pathologies, and demonstrate empirically that common multi-winner election rules for selecting representatives do not perform well in expectation. To analyze the behavior of FRD, we begin by providing theoretical results on how issue-speciﬁc delegations determine outcomes. Finally, we provide empirical results comparing the outcomes of RD with ﬁxed sets of proxies across issues versus FRD with issuespeciﬁc delegations. Our results show that variants of Proxy Voting yield no discernible beneﬁt over RD and reveal the potential for FRD to improve outcomes as voter participation increases, further motivating the use of issue-speciﬁc delegations.
1 Introduction
Since the Athenian Ecclesia in 595 BCE Direct Democracy (DD) as an ideal collective decision making scheme has loomed large in the western imagination [18]. While DD may be desirable it becomes impractical at scale because it places too much burden on individual decisions makers: everyone must be well-informed on every issue and always available to vote [24]. In addition to the attention requirements, voters are also required to know and be able to articulate their preferences at the time of every vote. While preferences and preference learning are large research areas in AI [17, 22], every voter may not have enough knowledge, information, time, or energy to participate, particularly when issues are complex.
Given the prohibitive costs of implementing a large-scale Direct Democracy in both human and agent societies, we often resort to forms of representation, relying upon a set of proxies to decide
1

on the voters’ behalf. Countries have parliaments, companies have shareholders, and even groups of agents select leaders to represent them [45]. Sets of representatives have been used in many contexts and disciplines to reduce the computation and communication burden of decision makers. Within computer science, many applications face the task of selecting representatives for downstream decision making. In portfolio selection a particular set of algorithms and hyper-parameters are selected from a large pool of candidates and then used as representatives for later problems [30], in multi-agent systems the role assignment problem uses distributed voting to decide on tasks for agents [46], and in group recommendation settings this can correspond to picking a set of experts to later make decisions. The COMSOC community [11] has produced a large body of research on how to select and weight representatives. Indeed, using multi-winner voting [41], we can view the winners as a set of exemplars that may be used to decide some downstream application – e.g., we select a set of points in space and then aggregate these points (votes) over the set.
Often it is beneﬁcial to elect ﬁxed committees which meet certain axiomatic criteria. For example, committees should be proportional and have justiﬁed representation of the voters [4]. Intuitively, these difﬁculties in electing committees carry through to the setting of Representative Democracy (RD) where the committee makes decisions in the interest of the voters/agents who elect them [40]. As the prevalence and security of the internet improve, many scholars and companies are turning toward computer systems to address issues with democratic decision making systems; some going so far to suggest that we create an AI-based Direct Democracy or an “Augmented Democracy” 1.
Since DD is impractical and RD comes with inherent tradeoffs and limitations, hybridizations of the two have arisen under the umbrella of interactive democracy. This idea, coupled with modern communication technologies, has spawned a large number of proposed democratic decision making systems, and interactive democracy has become an important area of research and application for AI [12]. Perhaps the most popular version of this today is Liquid Democracy. Liquid Democracy has received signiﬁcant attention in the political science [24], AI [28] and agents communities [13], and has been implemented in both corporate [27] and political settings [10, 7].
In contrast to existing interactive democracy proposals, our model of Flexible Representative Democracy maintains a set of expert representatives while allowing voters to guarantee their own representation without raising the minimum required burden on them. In an FRD voters elect a set of representatives to serve a term during which they decide the outcomes over a set of issues. Each voter, by default, allocates a fraction of their voting power to each member of the committee. If this allocation is uniform and we stop here, we are left with a traditional model of RD where each representative has equal power. However, for each issue under consideration in FRD, the voters can deviate from this default by delegating their voting power over any subset the committee. If all voters use their option to delegate on each issue, as long as there is at least one representative who agrees with each voter’s view, the outcome can become exactly that of DD. Voters have both the election and the ﬂexible delegation option as tools for achieving representation and holding representatives accountable.
In an FRD, voters have great ﬂexibility in determining how they are represented and the mandated disclosure of representatives’ votes guarantees that an attentive voter can be fully informed about how their voting power will be and was used. For example, the day after the election an inattentive voter might choose a few elected representatives they trust, apportion the power of their

vote to these few for all future issues and pay no attention until the next election. A more attentive voter might alter their allocations on an issue-by-issue basis as issues arise, reacting to representatives’ votes. In general, voters determine the granularity with which they privately express their preferences over issues via the representatives. Thus, the degree to which Direct Democracy is emulated by a Flexible Representative Democracy depends both on the caliber of the representatives and the fastidiousness of the voters.
1.1 Contributions
We introduce Flexible Representative Democracy (FRD), a new model of interactive democracy which smoothly transitions, at the discretion of the voters, between Representative Democracy and Direct Democracy. Our proposal for FRD solves standing issues in the literature on interactive democracy including maintaining a ﬁxed, elected committee to generate legislation and making delegation cycles impossible. We analyze our model in decision making scenarios involving binary, symmetric issues and (1) show that electing an optimal set of representatives is hard for any large-scale Representative Democracy that uses a multi-winner voting rule, (2) investigate the performance of various deterministic multi-winner voting rules to select committees, (3) demonstrate the theoretical ability of issue-speciﬁc delegations under FRD to overcome the limitations of Representative Democracy, and (4) provide empirical results demonstrating that FRD outperforms both Representative Democracy and Proxy Voting for representing the will of the voters.
2 Model and Preliminaries
We primarily consider three democratic decision systems: Direct Democracy (DD), Representative Democracy (RD), and our model of Flexible Representative Democracy (FRD), which we deﬁne as follows.
Given a set of voters V with preferences over the alternatives for each issue in a set of issues S, we represent their collective preferences by a preference proﬁle PV,S. In a direct democracy, a decision rule RS is applied directly to the voters’ preference proﬁle to obtain a set of issue outcomes, RS (PV,S ) → ODD.2
By contrast, in a representative system voters’ preferences on the issues may never be directly elicited. Rather, voters report their preferences over a set of candidates seeking election C. We denote the collective preferences of the voters over the candidates by the electoral proﬁle PV,C. An election rule (i.e. multi-winner voting rule) is then used to aggregate these preferences and select a subset of candidates to serve as representatives, RE (PV,C) → D ⊆ C. In a standard representative democracy, a decision rule is then applied to the preferences of the representatives to determine the outcomes on all issues, RS(PD,S) → ORD. Clearly, RD may produce different outcomes than DD, and may leave accessible information about voter preferences unsolicited and unused. Flexible Representative Democracy endeavors to use this information if and when it is available without relying entirely upon it.
2For clarity, we will refer to a social choice function RS which determines the outcome of an inanimate issue as a decision rule, and a social choice function RE which selects from among candidates to serve as voting representatives as an election rule. Our deﬁnitions are easily extended to social welfare functions.
3

As with RD, in FRD the voters elect a set of representatives RE (PV,C) → D ⊆ C. However, for every issue, divisible units of voting power (votes) are given to the voters rather than simply
giving a vote to each representatives. Automatically after the election, the voters’ issue-speciﬁc votes are distributed among the representatives according to some default distribution mechanism.
Subsequently, every voter has the option to alter how their voting power is assigned to the repre-
sentatives on an issue-by-issue basis and we refer to this active process of allocating voting power to representatives as delegation. We let Wjil represent the voting power allocated by voter vj to candidate cl on issue si, yielding a collective matrix of weights W . To determine the outcomes of a set of issues in FRD, a decision rule is applied to the representatives’ preferences which takes these weights into account RS(PD,S, W ) → OF RD.

2.1 Model Speciﬁcation

Our objective is to compare the extent to which RD and FRD can emulate the decision which

would be made under DD with binary issues. In our speciﬁcation, each voter in the set of voters

V = {v1, . . . , vN } has a preferred outcome vji ∈ {0, 1} for every issue si in the set of issues S =

{s1, . . . , sr}.

We

let

vj

=

{vj1

,

.

.

.

,

v

r j

}

represent

the

full

preferences

of

voter

vj

over

the

issues,

yielding the collective approval proﬁle PV,S = {vj : vj ∈ V}. Similarly, in our representative

systems we can represent the preference proﬁle of the candidates PC,S = {cl : cl ∈ C} where candidate cl has preferences cl ∈ {0, 1}r. Without loss of generality, we label the outcome preferred

by the weak majority of voters 1 and the other 0, breaking ties randomly (when N is even).

Generally, we deﬁne the agreement between any two outcome vectors O1, O2 as L(O1, O2) =

1 − 1r

r i=1

|O1i

−

O2i |.

Thus

we

will

often

refer

to

the

agreement

between

a

voter

and

candidate

L(vj, cl) and the agreement between the outcomes produced by different democratic systems, i.e.

L(ODD, ORD).

We consider three possible ways voters might express their preferences over the candidates:

approvals, total orderings, and normalized weights. In our simulation and analysis we make a

large assumption about these preferences to give RD the greatest chance of maximizing L(ODD,

ORD). Namely, we assume each voters’ preferences over each candidate is induced by their level

of agreement. When voters submit approval ballots, we assume vj approves of cl if and only if

L(vj, cl) > 1/2. When voters report total orderings ( j), we assume they order all candidates so

that cl j ch implies L(vj, cl) ≥ L(vj, ch) where ties are broken privately (e.g. randomly). When
voters report their preferences as normalized weights, wjl = L(vj,cl)/ ch∈C L(vj,ch).3 The collective preferences of the voters over the candidate set yield the proﬁle PV,C, which may consist of ap-

proval, ordinal, or normalized cardinal preferences.

For Direct Democracy, we only consider the simple majority rule as our decision rule RS be-

cause our issues are binary and symmetric. However, for our representative systems, we compare

several common, anonymous election rules RE with a ﬁxed, odd committee size k so that the set

of elected representatives is D ⊆ C where |D| = k. All rules considered are deterministic other

than randomized tie-breaking. In the setting where voters submit approval ballots, we consider

Approval Voting and Re-weighted Approval Voting (AV, RAV). When voters submit their pref-

erences over candidates as total orderings, we consider Single-Transferrable Vote (STV), Borda,

3These normalized weights reported during the election process should not be confused with the weights (voting power) assigned to representatives later by default and through delegation.

4

k-Median, and Chamberlin-Courant (CC). When voters submit their ballots as normalized weights over the candidates, we consider the rule which selects the k candidates who receive the largest total weight. Lastly, we compare these rules to sortition, selecting k representatives uniformly at
random from the candidates. Formal deﬁnitions of AV, RAV, STV, and Borda can be found in the book chapter by [47] and deﬁnitions of CC and k-Median can be found in [40].
Given a set D of k elected representatives we want to evaluate the capability of this set to
represent the will of the voters, i.e., recover the outcome of a Direct Democracy. To this end we introduce the notions of coverage, full coverage, and majority agreement. Let k1i and k0i represent the number of representatives who prefer 1 and 0 on issue si respectively, such that k1i + k0i = k.

Majority Agreement. There is majority agreement on an issue if the majority of representatives

agree

with

the

majority

of

voters

(k1i

>

k 2

>

k0i ).

Coverage. An issue is covered if at least one representative agrees with the voter majority (0 < k1i ).

Full Coverage. An issue is fully covered if the representatives are not unanimous (0 < k1i < 1).

Bear in mind that in practice the number of representatives on either side of the issue is known,
but it is not known which side corresponds to the voter majority. Therefore the majority agreement
of any set of representatives for an issue may be unknown, but it is always known on which issues
they achieve full coverage. Full coverage implies coverage, but otherwise the status of coverage is
unknown.
For FRD, we allocated each voter one divisible vote for each independent issue, maintaining the
principle of “one person, one vote”. Once the representatives have been elected, each voter’s unit
of voting power is distributed among the representatives on each issue. In this paper we distribute this power uniformly by default, so initially Wli = N/k for each of the k candidates and r issues. Various distributions from the literature on voting power [38, 6] and Proxy Voting [1] are worth
consideration. We do not consider abstentions by representatives nor voter abstentions, whereby a
voter assigns less than a full vote to the representatives as a whole. The total voting power held by the representatives remains N collectively for all issues.
We refer to the fraction of voters who use their delegation option as the delegation rate αi, and the delegations rates may differ for the majority and minority (α0i , α1i ). For our purposes, the total weight Wli assigned to representative dl on issue si is the sum of the voting power they receive from default and delegation j Wjil. Consequently, the total weight assigned to representatives who agree with the voter majority is X1i = di=1 Wli. In this paper our decision rule for FRD is
l
weighted majority with random tie breaking. That is, Oi = 1 if X1i > N2 , Oi = 0 if X1i < N2 , and Oi = 1 with probability 1/2 if X1i = N2 .
In our theoretical analysis we assume that voters who delegate do so optimally after the repre-
sentatives have voted. A voter delegates optimally if they only delegate voting power to represen-
tatives who agree with their preferred outcome on an issue. This is equivalent to restricting voters
to only delegate to a single representative, or to vote directly on the issue (if there is full cover-
age). We relax the assumption of optimal delegations in our simulations and consider voters who
delegate only to their most preferred candidate(s) or divide their delegation evenly across their ap-
proved set. If an issue is not fully covered because the representatives are unanimous, the outcome
is already determined since opposing voters have no one to whom they can delegate. We discuss
this further in Section 7.

Example 1. Consider an FRD instance with issues s1 and s2, three voters, and three represen-

tatives. Below, the solid arrows from voter to representative indicate delegations, and any voter

without an arrow defaults on that issue. The voter and representative preferences are given in the

tables above and below the agents. Notice that both delegations are optimal.

Issue s1

Issue s2

vji 1 1 0

vj v1 v2 v3

v1 v2 v3

dl d1 d2 d3 dil 1 1 0 Wli 2/3 2/3 5/3

d1 d2 d3 100 5/3 2/3 2/3

X11 = 4/3 < N/2

X12 = 5/3 > N/2

O1 = 0

O2 = 1

On issue s1, the representative majority agrees with the voter majority, so RD would yield OR1 D = 1 as desired. However, since only the voter in the minority (v31 = 0) delegates, the weighted majority
of representatives now decides the outcome in favor of the voter minority (X11 < 1/2). This can oc-

cur if the number of voters in the minority is large enough, the number of representatives who agree

with the voter minority is large enough, and the voters in the minority delegate at a substantially

higher rate than the voters in the majority.

On issue s2 the representative majority disagrees with the voter majority so the RD outcome

(without delegations) would be, regrettably, OR1 D = 0. Looking again at the ﬁgure we see the delegations ﬂip the result to what would be achieved by Direct Democracy (X12 > 1/2). Hence,
FRD can improve the outcomes over RD as measured against DD. Fortunately, for both s1 or s2,

if any two or all of the voters delegate optimally, the outcome will always agree with the voter

majority.

3 Related Work
[33], inspired by [43] and shareholder proxy voting, suggested an interactive democratic system for legislation that could take place at scale using computers. Miller lamented the lack of ﬂexibility in traditional Representative Democracy and sought to remedy this using a dynamic system of proxies, although admitted this was not conducive to creating legislation. Soon after, [39] warned that electronic systems may accelerate the legislative process in undesirable ways and suggested holding every referendum twice to guarantee time for sufﬁcient public deliberation. Our use of a ﬁxed, elected set of representatives answers Miller’s question of how to produce legislation, and rather than holding redundant referenda we give the voters sufﬁcient time to continue deliberation and alter their delegations after the representatives vote.
Just before the dawn of the internet, [44] revisited the ideas in a proposal that motivates the
6

default distribution and delegation mechanism in FRD [43]. The notion of the default distribution is also similar to that proposed by [1], which suggests that the weights of representatives be based on the preferences of voters expressed in the election, but these weights are ﬁxed during their term. By contrast, in FRD the weight of each representative on each issue is not strictly determined by the election. [16] took an analytical approach to studying a Proxy Voting model very close to that of [1] for decision making with no election, inﬁnite voters, spatial preferences, and assuming agents lie in a metric space.
The hallmark of an interactive democracy is that rather than adjudicating whether a direct or representative system is better for expressing the will of the voters and asserting it by ﬁat, the extent to which the system is direct or representative is itself a function of the will of the voters. Currently, the most well-known and well-studied form of Interactive Democracy is Liquid Democracy, which has been studied from an algorithmic perspective as a decision-making process in the AI and COMSOC literature [13, 28, 9, 14] and elsewhere [24, 21, 10, 12, 27]. Unlike Liquid Democracy, FRD does not allow transitive delegations nor delegations to another voter, thereby violating the second axiom proposed by [24]. However, as we discuss in Section 7, the notion of voluntary representatives can be maintained if desired for a particular application. Fractional delegations in FRD serve a similar function to that of the virtual committees proposed by [24], although in theory FRD could incorporate virtual committees as well as many other mechanisms for delegating voting power.
The design of FRD is also largely based on work in probabilistic voting, binary aggregation, statistical decision theory, and computational social choice. In particular, work on the optimal weighting of experts [5, 35, 25, 34, 8], the Condorcet Jury Theorem [26], variable electorates [20, 42, 36], and optimal committee sizes [3, 29, 32]. In FRD, one can view the voter delegations as a pseudo-tie breaking mechanism for the representatives or, conversely, see the default distribution as a way to dampen the variance in the outcome which occurs in Direct Democracy when the sample of participating voters is small or biased. Another view is that electing representatives is analogous to a compression algorithm [37], which is the algorithmic version of John Adams’s alleged intuition that the representatives should be a microcosm of the population (taken from [1]). In this view, the delegations in FRD are a decompression mechanism where a higher delegation rate reduces the “loss” of representation. Our evaluations are similar to those of [40], however, in their approval model the quality of the committee is measured as the sum of the voter proportion being represented for each issue, while we focus only on the total number of issues correct according to DD.
4 Difﬁculties of Representative Democracy
Electing good committees is hard. Electing a set of representatives which maximizes majority agreement on binary issues is NP-Hard even if we know the view of every voter on every issue. But suppose we wanted to solve the easier problem of maximizing coverage. Even maximizing coverage is NP-Hard, as is maximizing full coverage. If the majority view of the voters were known, maximum coverage could be approximated deterministically in polynomial time within a factor of 1 − 1/e by a greedy algorithm, and this bound is tight [19]. Therefore, none of our deterministic polynomial-time election rules can provide a better guarantee than this. Worse yet, even for small instances where the problem is computationally tractable, there are pathological
7

examples for which truthful voters whose derived preferences over the candidates are perfectly consistent with their preferences over the issues will elect horrible representatives.
We refer to the problems of selecting k representatives to maximize coverage, full coverage, and majority agreement as Max k-Coverage, Max k-Full Coverage, and Max k-Majority Agreement, respectively. Below we provide complexity results and pathologies, followed by simulated results to show how well our various polynomial time multi-winner voting rules perform in terms of majority agreement when voter and candidate preferences are generated uniformly at random.
Theorem 2. If the outcome preferred by the majority of voters is known for every issue, Max k-Coverage is NP-hard.
The theorem can be stated more explicitly as follows. Consider a set of binary issues S = {s1, . . . , sr} and a set of candidates C = {c1, . . . , cm} where each candidate has preference cil ∈ {0, 1} on each issue si, the problem of selecting the subset of k candidates D ⊆ C that maximizes the number of issues si on which dl∈D dil > 0 is NP-Hard.
Proof. Our proof of the hardness of Max k-Coverage is a reduction from the NP-Hard problem of MAX K-COVER [23, 19]. The input to MAX K-COVER is a set U = {x1, . . . , xr} of r points, a collection S = {s1, . . . , sm} of subsets of U , and an integer k. The objective of MAX K-COVER is to select k subsets from S such that their union has maximum cardinality. Given an instance (U, S, k) of MAX K-COVER we create an instance of Max k-Coverage as follows. For every point xi ∈ U create an issue si and for every subset sl ∈ S create a candidate cl. For all points xi and subsets sl, if xi ∈ sl then let cil = 1, otherwise let cil = 0. And let k be the number of representatives we will elect. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the number of issues covered by our k representatives and the cardinality of the corresponding subsets in the original max k-cover instance. Therefore, any set of k candidates that maximizes coverage corresponds exactly to a collection of k subsets in our MAX K-COVER instance whose union has maximum cardinality.
Note that if the majority view of the voters were known, coverage could be approximated deterministically in polynomial time within a factor of 1 − 1/e by a greedy algorithm, and this bound is tight [19]. Therefore, none of our deterministic polynomial-time election rules can provide a better guarantee than this, although they may provide decent approximations in expectation. The proofs for the two theorems below follow directly, although non-trivially, from our proof for Max k-Coverage.
Theorem 3. If the outcome preferred by the majority of voters is known for every issue, Max k-Full Coverage is NP-hard.
Proof. We now prove the hardness of Max k-Full Coverage by polynomial-time reduction from Max k-Coverage. To do this we construct an instance of Max k-Full Coverage by adding an additional candidate cˆ, adding r + 1 additional issues to the original r issues, and desire a set of k + 1 candidates. We show that in this new instance of Max k-Full Coverage the additional candidate must be selected in any optimal solution because they are uniquely required to cover the r + 1 added issues, and the remaining k candidates in the solution set correspond exactly to the optimal k candidates in the solution to our original Max k-Coverage instance.
8

Given an instance (S = {s1, . . . , sr}, C = {c1, . . . , cm}, k) of Max k-Coverage we construct an instance of Max k-Full Coverage as follows. Create a set of binary issues S˜ = S = {s1, . . . , sr} and augment it with r + 1 additional binary issues so that S˜ = {s1, . . . , sr, . . . , s2r+1}. Create a set of candidates C˜ = C ∪ cˆ where c˜il = cil for all cl ∈ C, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r and cˆi = 0 for all issues 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Let c˜il = 0 for all c˜l ∈ C˜\{cˆ} for issues r + 1 ≤ i ≤ 2r + 1 and let cˆi = 1 for all issues r + 1 ≤ i ≤ 2r + 1. Our objective is to select a set D˜ ⊆ C˜ of k + 1 candidates from C˜ which maximizes full coverage. We will now prove that for all solutions D˜ to our new Max k-Full Coverage problem, D˜ = {cˆ} ∪ D where D is a set of k candidates whose corresponding counterparts maximize coverage over issues {s1, . . . , sr} in our original Max k-Coverage instance.
Lemma 4. D˜ must contain cˆ
Proof. Clearly, the set {cˆ} ∪ {c˜l} achieves full coverage for issues {sr+1, . . . , s2r+1} for any c˜l ∈ C˜\{cˆ}, and any set which does not contain cˆ cannot fully cover (or cover) {sr+1, . . . , s2r+1}. Since {sr+1, . . . , s2r+1} comprises more than half the issues, any set of k + 1 candidates for k ≥ 1 which maximizes the number of issues fully covered, must contain cˆ.
Given that cˆi = 0 for all issues {s1, . . . , sr}, the set of candidates D = D˜\{cˆ}, which maximizes full coverage for issues {s1, . . . , sr} is the set of k candidates which maximizes coverage over issues in {s1, . . . , sr}. Therefore, the k candidates corresponding to D are the solution to our original instance of Max k-Coverage and given the solution D to Max k-Coverage we simply add cˆ to ﬁnd D˜.
Theorem 5. If the outcome preferred by the majority of voters is known for every issue, Max k-Majority Agreement is NP-hard.
Proof. We now prove the hardness of Max k-Majority Agreement by polynomial-time reduction from our problem of Max k-Coverage. Similar to our proof for Max k-Full Coverage, we replicate the instance of Max k-Coverage and add r + 1 issues to the original r issues such that |S˜| = 2r + 1. However, we now augment the candidate set with k + 1 additional candidates who must be included in any committee which maximizes majority agreement. The objective is to select the 2k + 1 candidates which maximize majority agreement. The k + 1 additional candidates must be in the solution set for Max k-Majority Agreement, and the remaining k candidates selected will correspond exactly to the k candidates in the solution to our original instance of Max k-Coverage.
Given an instance of Max k-Coverage with input (S = {s1, . . . , sr}, C = {c1, . . . , cm}, k) we construct an instance of Max k-Majority Agreement with input (S˜ = {s˜1, . . . , s˜r˜}, C˜ = {c˜1, . . . , c˜m˜ }, k˜) as follows. Create a set of binary issues S˜ = {s˜1, . . . , s˜2r+1} and a set of candidates C˜ = {c˜1, . . . , c˜m+k+1}. We can think of C˜ as being made up of three sets of candidates based on how we will construct their preferences over S˜, that is, C˜ = {c˜1, . . . , c˜m} ∪ {c˜m+1, . . . , c˜m+k} ∪ {c˜m+k+1}. The ﬁrst set {c˜1, . . . , c˜m} has identical preferences to the m candidates in the original problem over the ﬁrst r issues, and prefers 0 on the rest. The second set {c˜m+1, . . . , c˜m+k} unanimously prefer the outcome of 1 on all issues. The last candidate c˜m+k+1 prefers 0 on the ﬁrst r issues, and 1 on the remaining r + 1 issues. Formally, for l ≤ m, c˜il = cil for i ≤ r and c˜il = 0 for r < i ≤ 2r + 1. For m < l < m + k + 1, c˜il = 1 for all i. And for l = m + k + 1, c˜il = 0 for i ≤ r and c˜il = 1 for r < i ≤ 2r + 1. Lemma 6. Any set D˜ ⊆ C˜ of 2k + 1 representatives which maximizes majority agreement must contain {c˜m+1, . . . , c˜m+k+1}.
9

Proof. Clearly, D˜ agrees with the voter majority on issues {sr+1, . . . , s2r+1} if and only if D˜ contains {c˜m+1, . . . , c˜m+k+1}, because this is the only way at least k+1 out of the 2k+1 representatives can agree with the voter majority on any of these issues. This directly implies there is agreement on more than half the issues if and only if {c˜m+1, . . . , c˜m+k+1} ⊆ D˜.
Selecting candidates {c˜m+1, . . . , c˜m+k+1} provides exactly k representatives who agree with the voter majority on issues {s1, . . . , sr}. Since we are selecting 2k + 1 representatives in total, on any of these ﬁrst r issues we need only 1 more representative who agrees with the voter majority on each issue to achieve majority agreement. Therefore, selecting k additional representatives from {c˜1, . . . , c˜m} which maximize coverage over issues {s1, . . . , sr}, maximizes the majority agreement of the 2k + 1 representatives over S˜. Clearly, these k representatives are a one-to-one correspondence to the k representatives in the solution to our original Max k-Coverage problem. Likewise, given the solution to the original Max k-Coverage problem, taking the corresponding candidates and adding {c˜m+1, . . . , c˜m+k+1} maximizes majority agreement.

Figure 2: Comparison of NP-hard rules with our polynomial rules for |C| = 17, |S| = 80, |V| = 51. We cannot scale this graph in the same was Figure 1 due to the high computational cost of computing the winning sets for k−Median and CC. However, from this small sample we see that Weights, STV, and AV all strictly dominate both CC and k−Median in terms of agreement.

4.1 Simulation Results

We investigate the properties of coverage and majority agreement as functions of the numbers of

candidates, issues, and committee size. In all our simulations, for all issues s1 we let vji = 1 and

cil

=

1

with

probability

for

all

voters

and

candidates.

In

all

of

our

runs,

coverage

was

1.0

for

all

combinations, hence we omit it from the graphs in Figures 1 and 5. For all simulations we perform

50 iterations at each datapoint and plot the mean of these runs. Variance for all points is ≤ 0.002

so our results are robust to noise [15].

For a ﬁrst set of simulations we included rules that have NP-hard winner determination prob-

lems: Chamberlin-Courant and k−Median. We implemented these rules in Gurobi 8.1 using an

ILP formulation based off one given by [31] for OWA based assignments. Even with a relatively

optimized implementation it still took almost 24 hours to generate Figure 5 on a server with 16

cores and 32 GB of memory. Looking at Figure 5 we see that both CC and k−Median are strictly

dominated by Weights, STV, and AV at all committee sizes. Hence, to run experiments on larger

samples of voters and issues we drop the NP-hard rules as they do not seem to offer a particular

advantage over the easy to compute rules.

For our larger simulations we hold |V| = 501 ﬁxed as we did not observe a strong dependence

on the number of voters as long as it was sufﬁciently larger than the number of candidates. Turning

ﬁrst to Figure 1a we hold |C| = 60, |k| = 21 and vary |S| ∈ {15, . . . , 150} in steps of 15. We

see that for a small number of issues the AV, RAV, and the weighted voting rule can be expected

to select a committee in agreement with the majority nearly 80% of the time. However, as we

add issues to the docket, the voting rules seem to converge around 60%. In Figure 1b we ﬁx

|k| = 21, |S| = 150 and vary the number of candidates between |C| ∈ {21, . . . , 100} in steps of 5.

We observe again that AV, RAV, and weighted voting are the best followed closely by STV. As we

increase the number of candidates it is possible for the system to more frequently recover the will

of the majority but this number does not climb above 65% across all treatments. Finally, in Figure

1c we hold |C| = 100, |S| = 150 and vary |k|.

These simulations reinforce the idea that electing an ideal committee, i.e., one that represents

11

the will of the majority of the voters on every issue, is a hard problem. In the next section we will explore how FRD can out preform RD and its dependence on the constituent delegation rates (α1, α0).

5 Beneﬁts of Flexibility
The ﬂexibility of issue-speciﬁc delegations is the motivating feature of FRD. We look ﬁrst at basic features of FRD in a deterministic setting before considering probabilistic delegations.

5.1 Deterministic Delegation

A voter’s delegation is optimal if the voter only delegates to representatives who agree with them

on that issue. Observe that if the representatives are unanimous only one outcome is possible, but

as long as there is some dissent in the committee opinions FRD can take advantage and return

decision making power to the voters.

We denote by N1i+N0i = N the numbers of voters and by k0i +k1i = k the numbers of candidates

who agree and disagree with the voter majority on issue si, respectively. We have labeled the

majority view of the voters as 1, so ∀si

∈

S

:

N1i

≥

N 2

≥

N0i. The overall outcome of any resolute

democratic process over this set of issues is a single outcome vector O = {O1, . . . , Or} ∈ {0, 1}r,

and our ideal outcome is {1}r. Treating all issues equally and independently, we seek to maximize

si∈S Oi. Let λi0 = α0i N0i ∈ Z and λi1 = α1i N1i ∈ Z be the number of voters who delegate in favor of each outcome, assuming they delegate optimally. We drop the i superscript below because we

will be talking about a single issue.

Theorem 8. If all delegations are optimal and the issue is fully covered (0 < k1 < k), the outcome is guaranteed to agree with the voter majority if the number of voters in the majority who delegate (λ1) is greater than N2k(−k−2Nk11)k1 .

Proof. For the majority to guarantee the outcome in their favor by delegating optimally, this means

that even if all voters in the minority delegate optimally, the outcome must still be 1. Recall that X1

is the total weight assigned by default and delegation to representatives who prefer the outcome 1.

Let

(N1−λ1) kk1

For

the outcome to be guaranteed in favor of the voter majority, it must be that X1 = (N1−λ1) kk1 +λ1 >

N2 . Solving for λ1 we ﬁnd that λ1 > N2k(−k−2Nk11)k1 . Note that this lower bound may be negative. In this

case k1 is so large and N0 is so small that the outcome is guaranteed regardless of delegations of

the minority, so λ1 ≥ 0.

Theorem 9. If all delegations are optimal and the issue is fully covered (0 < k1 < k), the outcome will favor the minority if λ0 > kλ1+(N−2λk11)(2k1−k) .

k1 = k − k0.

5.2 Probabilistic Delegation
Instead of assuming that some fractions (α1, α0) of voters delegate we investigate what happens if each voter chooses to delegate with some ﬁxed individual probability. These results gives us an
idea of how motivated or attentive voters must be to improve the outcome of FRD over RD. We
assume here that all voter and candidate preferences are independent for all issues. As all issues are independent, we will consider a single issue. Suppose each voter vj ∈ V
chooses to delegate (deviate from the default) with independent probability pj and that all delegations are optimal. Let xj ∈ [0, 1] be the amount of power voter vj assigns to candidates who agree with the voter majority (cl = 1), either by delegation or default. If vj defaults then xj = kk1 , if vj delegates optimally and is in the voter majority (vji = 1) then xj = 1, and if vj delegates optimally and is in the voter minority then xj = 0. Let X1 = xj be the
vj ∈V
total power assigned to these candidates via both delegation and default. Let µ = E[X1] = vj=1(pj + (1 − pj)k1/k) + vj=0(1 − pj)k1/k be the expected value of the total power assigned
to representatives who agree with the voter majority.

Theorem 10. Consider an FRD with an odd number of voters N , odd committee size k, and only
optimal delegations. Suppose each voter vj ∈ V delegates with probability pj on each issue such that µ > N/2. Then the probability that the outcome agrees with the voter majority is bounded by P (y = 1) ≥ 1 − e−(N−2µ)2/4N .

Proof Sketch: The probability that the outcome agrees with the voter majority is P (y = 1) = P (X1 > N/2) + P (y = 1|X1 = N/2) · P (X1 = N/2) where P (y = 1|X1 = N/2) is due to some tie-breaking mechanism. First we show that with odd voters, odd representatives and only optimal delegations there can be no ties. Namely, X1 = X0 = N − X1. This proof is due to parity and holds regardless of the delegation rate. Without ties, we simply need to determine P (X1 > N/2). We use a Chernoff inequality to provide a lower bound on this value based on the probability of delegation pj of all voters. See Section 7 for discussion about tie-breaking 4.

Proof. Recall that xj ∈ [0, 1] is the amount of voting power voter vj assigns to candidates who agree with the voter majority on an issue and X1 = vj∈V xj. Given some tie breaking rule, we have that P (y = 1) = P (X1 > N/2) + P (y = 1|X1 = N/2) · P (X1 = N/2). First we show that P (X1 = N/2) = 0, then we give a lower bound for P (X1 > N/2).
Lemma 11. If N is odd, k is odd, and all delegations are optimal, then no ties are possible.

Proof. Let xj = k · xj where xj ∈ [0, 1] is the amount of weight (voting power) voter vj assigns

to candidates who agree with the voter majority on an issue via default or delegation. If vj defaults

then xj = k1, if vj delegates optimally and is in the voter majority (vji = 1) then xj = k, and if

vj delegates optimally and is in the voter minority then xj = 0. Therefore, ∀j : xj ∈ {0, k1, k}.

Let X1 = xj and X0 = (k − xj). Then X1, X0 are non-negative integers and X1 + X0 =

vj ∈V

vj ∈V

kN . Since kN is odd, it must be that X1 and X0 have opposite parity and so they cannot be

13

equal. Therefore X1 = X1/k = X0 = X0/k, meaning the total amounts of weight delegated to the representatives on either side of the issue cannot be equal, so no ties may occur.

Given that no ties are possible, we have that P (y = 1) = P (X1 > N/2). Remember that

X1 = xj where xj is the total weight that vj delegates to representatives who agree with the

vj ∈V

voter

majority.

We now use the fact that P (X1 > N/2) = 1 − P (X1 ≤ N/2). Let δ = (2µ − N )/2µ. If µ > N/2, then δ > 0. This allows us to apply a Chernoff bound to derive our lower bound

P (X1 > N/2) = 1 − P (X1 ≤ N/2) = 1 − P (X1 ≤ (1 − δ)µ) ≥ 1 − e−δ2µ2/N = 1 − e−(2µ−N)2/4N

This bound depends on the mild condition that µ > N/2. This requires that the delegation rate of the majority α1 cannot be too small relative to the minority α0. Observe that this condition is satisﬁed when ∀j : pj = p and k1 > k/2. Furthermore, as an increasing number of voters delegate optimally, we expect µ → N1 > N/2 regardless of k1. Naturally, as the delegation rate increases (α → 1), we observe our lower bound approach the ideal 1 − e−(2µ−N)2/4N → 1. To ﬁnd µ ≤ N/2, the voter majority cannot be too large compared to the voter minority, k1 must be smaller than or somewhat close to k0, and/or the voters in the majority must be signiﬁcantly more apathetic towards delegation than voters in the minority.
Tighter bounds may be achieved when the delegation probabilities are assumed to come from a particular distribution. It is an interesting open question to see how the expected outcome is effected when voters have various motivations to delegate which give rise to different delegation probability distributions.
5.3 Simulated Delegations
Given our theoretical results on how FRD can improve the outcomes of a decision making process, we investigate the effect of the overall delegation rate α on recovering the ideal outcomes according to Direct Democracy. We use the same model to generate candidates and voter preferences as used in Section 4. For our simulated delegations we create instances with |V| = 301, |C| = 60, |S| = 150, and k = 21. We vary α ∈ {0, 1.0} in increments of 0.01 and for each setting of α we run 50 iterations. We plot the means in Figure 3 and note again that the variance is ≤ 0.002 at every point.
In Figure 3 we can see the agreement of the outcomes of FRD and RD for the weighted voting committee selection rule for several delegation types and delegation rates. For each of the instances we measure against a baseline of the proportion of issues where the outcome is that of DD. A value of 1.0 means that the outcomes of all issues are the same under the democracy as they would be in a Direct Democracy.

Figure 3: Weighted Voting Committee Selection

We compare RD with four different delegation schemes: (1) Approve where voters delegate evenly to the representatives in the committee of whom they approve and do not update; Best Rep where voters delegate to their single most preferred representative and do not update per issue; Best-3 Rep where voters delegate equally to their three most preferred members of the committee and do not update per issue; and ﬁnally Optimal where voters delegate to a single representative with whom they agree per issue.
Most surprising is how little delegations that are not active and optimal help emulate Direct Democracy. The Approve delegation system is perhaps closest to the proposal of Proxy Voting espoused by [33] but does not improve RD in a meaningful way. Similarly interesting are the 1-Best and 3-Best delegations, which also do not move the outcome towards the ideal of Direct Democracy. Hence, we can see that the issue-speciﬁc ﬂexibility FRD allows can be effectively used to improve outcomes of decision making systems. Another striking result in Figure 3 is how drastically FRD can improve agreement over RD when voters are highly attentive. With as little as 60% of the population delegating we can improve agreement by 10%, and when the delegation rate reaches 80% we see an almost 20% increase, eventually reaching 100% when everyone delegates if the issue is fully covered.

7 Conclusion
We have introduced a novel system of Interactive Democracy called Flexible Representative Democracy which transitions smoothly, at the discretion of the voters, between direct and representative. We have shown theoretically and empirically that FRD has the potential to overcome the shortcomings of other systems such as Representative Democracy and Proxy Voting. An important point to remember is that in FRD delegations are optional, and not an additional burden imposed on the system or voters. In contrast to Liquid Democracy, voters in FRD have greater certainly about how their vote will be cast ahead of time and delegation cycles are not possible. Furthermore, FRD maintains a ﬁxed, elected set of accountable representatives to produce legislation and hold public debates. This committee of representatives does not need to expand to guarantee proportional or
15

justiﬁed representation, because as long as there is full coverage of an issue voters have the power to collectively guarantee these properties for themselves.
In our analysis, we seek to create a best-case scenario for traditional RD to achieve high agreement: we assume the full list of issues is known, all voters participate, candidates are truthful and do not change their preferences after the election, and voter preferences over candidates are consistent with their preferences over the issues. Intuitively, relaxing any of these assumptions only strengthens the argument for enabling ﬂexible, issue-speciﬁc delegations. Flexible delegation also has the effect of minimizing the role that the choice of election rule plays in the outcome.
8 Extensions
In addition to the model laid out here, there are a number of interesting and important extensions to FRD that one could consider. Nothing in our system prevents moving to issues where there are non-binary domains and/or different domains for every issue. One can also consider asymmetric issues with decision rules other than simple majority rule, such as quota rules. Additionally, we have modeled the weight given to representatives as a simple sum of the defaults and delegations, but this could be any function and may treat delegations and defaults differently; though such a function should be monotone with respect to the delegated weights. Note that we can easily relax the assumptions in our analysis that there are an odd number of voters, optimal delegations, and no abstentions. Relaxing any of these requires us only to account for potential ties in the outcomes of our analysis.
If ties are broken randomly, then we only need to compute the probability of a tie occurring. This probability is computable, but in general we should not expect the xj values to come from a nice, symmetric, well-behaved distribution. It is also worth noting that ties can be broken in other ways including based on the observed delegation rate. For example, when the delegation rate is low one might break ties in favor of the representative majority, whereas when the delegation rate is high one might break ties in favor of the outcome with more weight delegated to it.
Lastly, one of the attractive features of Liquid Democracy is the notion of voluntary representatives who need not be formally elected. These voluntary representatives are not beholden to an election cycle and can be local leaders, with personal relationships to voters who support them. This can be incorporated into a Flexible Representative Democracy by allowing any voter or agent to become a voluntary representative on a single issue by casting their vote publicly by the same deadline as the elected representatives. However, voluntary representatives do not receive any voting power by default, may not receive delegated voting power on any issue before their vote is declared, and can only receive delegations on a per-issue basis. Since no voluntary representatives receive any default voting power, all of our results still hold.
In fact, the addition of representatives who receive no power by default constitutes a Pareto improvement because they effectively serve to guarantee full coverage (and coverage) and if the outcome changes as a result it can only change in the direction of the voter majority (assuming optimal delegations). Alternatively, an FRD can automatically add contrarian single-issue dummy representatives whenever the representatives do not achieve full coverage on an issue. Keep in mind that while full coverage can be artiﬁcially guaranteed in this way, any attempt to guarantee majority agreement would constitute rigging the election.

9.1 Preference Representation
For clariﬁcation, there are two ways voters could report their strict orderings over the candidates. The ﬁrst is a list where the position in the list denotes the rank and the value in the list denotes the candidate. This is what is typically thought of as an ordering. We use a second, equivalent, representation where the position in the list denotes the candidate and the value denotes their rank. Consider a paper ballot in which you want voters to rank their candidates in order of preference. The ﬁrst representation corresponds to writing the numbers 1, . . . , m on the paper and having the voters ﬁll in the names of the candidates next to them. Our second representation is like listing the candidates on the page, and having the voters ﬁll in the numbers next to the names to denote their rank. The choice of representation in practice does not impact our analysis, as they represent the exact same information. Similarly with approvals. Agents can just report the subset of candidates of which they approve, or they could write whether they approve next to each candidate name on a ballot. Again, we use the second representation and the two are equivalent.

9.2 Deterministic Theorems

The following theorems are all derived from the fact that y = 1 if (N − λ0 − λ1) kk1 + λ1 > (N − λ0 − λ1) kk0 + λ0, or equivalently (N − λ0 − λ1) kk1 + λ1 > N/2.

Theorem 12. If all delegations are optimal, and the representatives are not unanimous (e.g. the
issue is fully covered where 0 < k1 < k), the outcome is guaranteed to agree with the voter majority if the number of voters in the majority who delegate (λ1) is greater than N2k(−k−2Nk11)k1 .

Proof. For the majority to guarantee the outcome in their favor by delegating optimally, this means

that even if all voters in the minority delegate optimally, the outcome must still be 1. Recall that X1

is the total weight assigned by default and delegation to representatives who prefer the outcome 1.

Let

k1 k

=

(N1−λ1) kk1

+λ1.

For

the outcome to be guaranteed in favor of the voter majority, it must be that X1 = (N1−λ1) kk1 +λ1 >

N2 . Solving for λ1 we ﬁnd that λ1 > N2k(−k−2Nk11)k1 . Note that this lower bound may be negative. In this

20

case k1 is so large and N0 is so small that the outcome is guaranteed regardless of delegations of the minority, so λ1 ≥ 0.

Theorem 13. If all delegations are optimal, and the representatives are not unanimous (0 < k1 < k), the outcome will favor the minority if λ0 > kλ1+(N−2λk11)(2k1−k) .

Proof.

(N − λ0 − λ1) kk1 + λ1. The lower bound can be found directly by solving for λ0 and substituting

k1 = k − k0.

Theorem 5. No Representative Democracy using a Condorcet-consistent election rule in which voters report approvals or total orderings over the candidates can provide a bounded approximation of agreement with majority voting in a Direct Democracy.

Proof. The example that proves this statement comes from [2]. We have two candidates; the ideal candidate c1 and the worst conceivable candidate c2. In this case, the majority of the voters prefer the worse candidate because they agree on a greater number of issues. This also means that the majority of voters approve of the worse candidate but not the ideal candidate. This pathology arises because the majority of voters are in the minority on the majority of issues. Thus, if we only have duplicates of these two candidates for any k, there are cases in which the voters will elect representatives who achieve a majority agreement of 0 when a set of candidates exists who would achieve and agreement of 1. That is, L(ODD, ORD) = 0.

Committee Size (k)

Figure 5: Comparison of NP-hard rules with our polynomial rules for |C| = 17, |S| = 80, |V| = 51. We cannot scale this graph in the same was Figure 1 due to the high computational cost of computing the winning sets for k−Median and CC. However, from this small sample we see that Weights, STV, and AV all strictly dominate both CC and k−Median in terms of agreement.

9.3 Additional Simulated Results
For a ﬁrst set of simulations we included rules that have NP-hard winner determination problems but are optimal according to a different utility metric : Chamberlin-Courant and k−Median [40]. Even with a relatively optimized implementation it still took almost 24 hours to generate Figure 5 on a server with 16 cores and 32 GB of memory. Looking at Figure 5 we see that both CC and k−Median are dominated by Weights, STV, and AV at all committee sizes. Hence, to run experiments on larger samples of voters and issues we drop the NP-hard rules as they preform similarly to the easier to compute rules.
The results in Figure 5 are interesting in light of the theoretical results obtained by [40]. [40] show that it is optimal if we elect a committee using k-Median and use majority voting by the representatives. However, their optimality criteria explicitly incorporates the proportion of voters who are (mis)represented in the objective function. For agreement we do not trade off the weighting of how many voters are (mis)represented, we only look at the total agreement. It is interesting that CC and k-median are not optimal and an interesting direction for future work is investigating this phenomona.
In Figure 6 we can see the agreement of the outcomes of FRD and RD for the weighted voting, AV, and Borda election rules for several delegation types and delegation rates. For each of the instances we measure against a baseline of the proportion of issues where the outcome is that of DD. A value of 1.0 means that all issues are the same under the democracy as they would be in a Direct Democracy. Overall, this plots show that RD under any of these rules cannot achieve above ≈ 62% agreement with Direct Democracy in expectation.
Similarly interesting are the 1-Best and 3-Best delegations, which also do not move the outcome towards the ideal of Direct Democracy. Hence, we can see that the issue-speciﬁc ﬂexibility FRD allows can be effectively used to improve outcomes of decision making systems. Another striking result in Figure 6 is how drastically FRD can improve agreement over RD when voters are highly attentive. With as little as 60% of the population delegating we can improve agreement by 10%, and when the delegation rate reaches 80% we see an almost 20% increase, eventually reaching
