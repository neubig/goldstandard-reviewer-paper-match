{"title": "Nonparametric Quantile Regression for Prediction of Parking Data", "abstract": "In this paper we will explore the approach taken by Juban, Ohlson, Maasoumy, Poirier, and Kolter in their paper, \u201cA multiple quantile regression approach to the wind, solar, and price tracks of GEFCom2014\u201d [1] in detail as well as discuss general nonparametric quantile regression methods. Moreover, we have implemented the algorithms in [1] and created a scikit learn style python package1 to allow for the methods to be applied to generic data sets. We will present and discuss the results of using our implementation of the approach on parking occupancy data from the city of Seattle, WA.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "c2bd176f8f9c84f9ba52ffb8f8bd4e9299c0f0cf", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Tanner Fiez"]}
