{"title": "Socio-Cultural Cognitive Mapping to Identify Communities and Latent Networks", "abstract": "Deriving networks and communities from individual and group attributes is an important task in understanding social groups and relations. In this work we propose a novel methodology to derive networks and communities from socio-cultural data. Our methodology is based on socio-cultural cognitive mapping (SCM) and k-NN network modularity maximization (SCM + k-NN) that produces both a latent network and community assignments of entities based upon their socio-cultural and behavioral attributes. We apply this methodology to two real-world data sets and compare the community assignments by our methodology to those communities found by k-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Affinity Propagation. We then analyze the latent networks that are created by SCM + k-NN to derive novel insight into the nature of the communities. The community assignments found by SCM + k-NN are comparable to those produced by current unsupervised machine learning techniques. Additionally, in contrast to current unsupervised machine learning techniques SCM + k-NN also produces a latent network that gives additional insight into community relationships.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "73472692b6090a72e36e03127bb99fc2e6bc8de0", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Iain J.
