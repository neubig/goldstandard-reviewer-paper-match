{"title": "Graph Based Similarity Measures for Synonym Extraction from Parsed Text", "abstract": "We learn graph-based similarity measures for the task of extracting word synonyms from a corpus of parsed text. A constrained graph walk variant that has been successfully applied in the past in similar settings is shown to outperform a state-of-the-art syntactic vector-based approach on this task. Further, we show that learning specialized similarity measures for different word types is advantageous.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "249b7517a746b1389991e10fd618cad62e66c4df", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Einat Minkov", "William W.
