In reality, a large fraction of web queries are posed about a relatively small number of topics, like products, entertainment, current events, and so on. One way of exploiting this sort of regularity in web search is to build, from the information found on the web, comprehensive databases about specific topics. An appropriate interface to such a database can support complex structured queries which are impossible to answer with traditional topic-independent query methods. Here we discuss three case studies for this \u201cdata-centric\u201d approach to web search.
