{"title": "Value Alignment via Tractable Preference Distance", "abstract": "Preferences are ubiquitous in everyday life: we use our own subjective preferences whenever we want to make a decision to choose our most preferred alternative. Hence, the study of preferences in computer science and AI has been very active for a number of years with important theoretical and practical results [13,21] as well as libraries and datasets [20]. In many scenarios including multiagent systems [25] and recommender systems [22], user preference play a key role in driving the decisions the system makes. Thus it is important to have preference modeling frameworks that allow for expressive and compact representations, effective elicitation techniques, and efficient reasoning and aggregation. If we want people to trust AI systems, we need to provide these systems with the ability to discriminate between what one would broadly call \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d decisions. In many instances, the quality of a decision should not be based only on the preferences or optimization criteria of the decision makers, but also on properties related to the impact of the decision such as whether or not it is ethical or legal according to constraints or priorities given by any number of exogenous sources [5,24,26]. Indeed, there may be specific ethical principles, depending on the context, that could and should override the subjective preferences of the decision maker. For the subjective preferences, they may apply to one or more of the individual components of a complex decision, rather than to the whole thing. For example, if we need to choose a car, we may prefer certain colors over others, and we may prefer certain brands over others. We may also have conditional preferences, such as in preferring red cars if the car is a convertible. For these scenarios, the CP-net formalism [6] is a convenient and expressive way to model preferences that has been used widely in the preference handling community [8,12,15,23]. CP-nets provide an effective, compact CONTENTS", "year": 2018, "ssId": "b48f0652605f981b5d407496aba3d9756725264f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andrea Loreggia", "Nicholas Mattei", "Rossi", "K.
