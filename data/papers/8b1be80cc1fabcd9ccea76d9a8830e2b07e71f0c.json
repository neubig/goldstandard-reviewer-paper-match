{"title": "Playing the Imitation Game with deep learning", "abstract": "Besides the overpowering bouquet of raspberries in this guy's beer, this review is remarkable for another reason. It was produced by a computer program instructed to hallucinate a review for a \"fruit/vegetable beer.\" Using a powerful artificial-intelligence tool called a recurrent neural network, the software that produced this passage isn't even programmed to know what words are, much less to obey the rules of English syntax. Yet, by mining the patterns in reviews from the barflies at BeerAdvocate. com, the program learns how to generate similarly coherent (or incoherent) reviews.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "8b1be80cc1fabcd9ccea76d9a8830e2b07e71f0c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Zachary Chase Lipton", "C.
