{"title": "Improving historical spelling normalization with bi-directional LSTMs and multi-task learning", "abstract": "Natural-language processing of historical documents is complicated by the abundance of variant spellings and lack of annotated data. A common approach is to normalize the spelling of historical words to modern forms. We explore the suitability of a deep neural network architecture for this task, particularly a deep bi-LSTM network applied on a character level. Our model compares well to previously established normalization algorithms when evaluated on a diverse set of texts from Early New High German. We show that multi-task learning with additional normalization data can improve our model\u2019s performance further.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "0132cb4384c3a6402353d8f349f8dd450d8ea4a2", "arXivId": "1610.07844", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07844.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Marcel Bollmann", "Anders S\u00f8gaard"]}
