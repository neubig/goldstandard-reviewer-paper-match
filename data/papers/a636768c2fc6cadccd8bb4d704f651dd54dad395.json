{"title": "Recognition and Analysis of Emotion in Indonesian Conversational Speech", "abstract": "The importance of incorporating emotional aspect in human computer interaction continues to arise. Unfortunately, exploration of the subject in Indonesian is still very lacking. This paper presents the first study of emotion recognition in Indonesian on conversational speech. We construct our corpus, IDESC, by making use of television talk show recordings in various topics of discussion, yielding colorful emotional utterances. Using the corpus, we then build a support vector machine (SVM) that classifies Indonesian speech in terms of emotion based on its acoustic features. We perform feature selection and parameter optimization while building the classifier to optimize the recognition performance, resulting in absolute 11.9% increase of accuracy. Lastly, we perform analyses on our corpus and evaluation result to gain better insight of emotion occurence in Indonesian speech.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "a636768c2fc6cadccd8bb4d704f651dd54dad395", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Lubis Nurul", "Sakti Sakriani", "Graham Neubig", "T.
