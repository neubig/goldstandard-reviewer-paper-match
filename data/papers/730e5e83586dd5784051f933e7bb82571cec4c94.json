{"title": "EEND-SS: Joint End-to-End Neural Speaker Diarization and Speech Separation for Flexible Number of Speakers", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel framework that jointly performs speaker diarization, speech separation, and speaker counting. Our proposed method combines end-to-end speaker diarization and speech separation methods, namely, End-to-End Neural Speaker Diarization with Encoder-Decoder-based Attractor calculation (EEND-EDA) and the Convolutional Time-domain Audio Separation Network (ConvTasNet) as multi-tasking joint model. We also propose the multiple 1\u00d71 convolutional layer architecture for estimating the separation masks corresponding to the number of speakers, and a post-processing technique for re\ufb01ning the separated speech signal with speech activity. Experiments using LibriMix dataset show that our proposed method outperforms the baselines in terms of diarization and separation performance for both \ufb01xed and \ufb02exible numbers of speakers, as well as speaker counting performance for \ufb02exible numbers of speakers. All materials will be open-sourced and reproducible in ESPnet toolkit 1 .", "year": 2022, "ssId": "730e5e83586dd5784051f933e7bb82571cec4c94", "arXivId": "2203.17068", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.17068.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yushi Ueda", "Soumi Maiti", "Shinji Watanabe", "Chunlei Zhang", "Meng Yu", "Shi-Xiong Zhang", "Yong Xu"]}
