{"title": "Estimating Reactions and Recommending Products with Generative Models of Reviews", "abstract": "Traditional approaches to recommendation focus on learning from large volumes of historical feedback to estimate simple numerical quantities (Will a user click on a product? Make a purchase? etc.). Natural language approaches that model information like product reviews have proved to be incredibly useful in improving the performance of such methods, as reviews provide valuable auxiliary information that can be used to better estimate latent user preferences and item properties. In this paper, rather than using reviews as an inputs to a recommender system, we focus on generating reviews as the model\u2019s output. This requires us to efficiently model text (at the character level) to capture the preferences of the user, the properties of the item being consumed, and the interaction between them (i.e., the user\u2019s preference). We show that this can model can be used to (a) generate plausible reviews and estimate nuanced reactions; (b) provide personalized rankings of existing reviews; and (c) recommend existing products more effectively.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "7df6aa19f50c8ec5f12d58e0685ed5c6e9a08bb2", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Jianmo Ni", "Zachary Chase Lipton", "S.
