{"title": "Iterative Set Expansion of Named Entities Using the Web", "abstract": "Set expansion refers to expanding a partial set of \"seed\" objects into a more complete set. One system that does set expansion is SEAL (set expander for any language), which expands entities automatically by utilizing resources from the Web in a language independent fashion. In a previous study, SEAL showed good set expansion performance using three seed entities; however, when given a larger set of seeds (e.g., ten), SEAL's expansion method performs poorly. In this paper, we present iterative SEAL (iSEAL), which allows a user to provide many seeds. Briefly, iSEAL makes several calls to SEAL, each call using a small number of seeds. We also show that iSEAL can be used in a \"bootstrapping\" manner, where each call to SEAL uses a mixture of user-provided and self-generated seeds. We show that the bootstrapping version of iSEAL obtains better results than SEAL even when using fewer user-provided seeds. In addition, we compare the performance of various ranking algorithms used in iSEAL, and show that the choice of ranking method has a small effect on performance when all seeds are user-provided, but a large effect when iSEAL is bootstrapped. In particular, we show that random walk with restart is nearly as good as Bayesian sets with user-provided seeds, and performs best with bootstrapped seeds.", "year": 2008, "ssId": "a75c2d26ca6a06cbee62a8d1dad5993356d96793", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Richard C.
