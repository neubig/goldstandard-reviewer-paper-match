{"title": "A Rule-Based System for Optimizing Combinational Logic", "abstract": "SOCRATES is a rule-based expert system that optimizes combinational logic for a specific target technology. The system performs substitutions of equivalent gate configurations, thereby reducing the overall area of the implementation and improving the speed of the design. A control mechanism uses various backup strategies to choose the rules applied to the circuit. Users can easily extend the library of transformation rules through a rule generation module that automatically encodes rules and inserts them into the knowledge base. Timing constraints placed on the circuit can be modified to allow the designer to explore a large design space in a matter of minutes. Implementations generated by the system are comparable in area and speed to circuits designed by experts.", "year": 1985, "ssId": "e11d6a031d5f85f372b0fda3ab62ca4ce2d89f2c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["A. de Geus", "William W.
