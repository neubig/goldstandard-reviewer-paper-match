{"title": "Multi-mode Transformer Transducer with Stochastic Future Context", "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models make fewer errors when more surrounding speech information is presented as context. Unfortunately, acquiring a larger future context leads to higher latency. There exists an inevitable trade-off between speed and accuracy. Na\u0131\u0308vely, to fit different latency requirements, people have to store multiple models and pick the best one under the constraints. Instead, a more desirable approach is to have a single model that can dynamically adjust its latency based on different constraints, which we refer to as Multi-mode ASR. A Multi-mode ASR model can fulfill various latency requirements during inference \u2014 when a larger latency becomes acceptable, the model can process longer future context to achieve higher accuracy and when a latency budget is not flexible, the model can be less dependent on future context but still achieve reliable accuracy. In pursuit of Multi-mode ASR, we propose Stochastic Future Context, a simple training procedure that samples one streaming configuration in each iteration. Through extensive experiments on AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech datasets, we show that a Multi-mode ASR model rivals, if not surpasses, a set of competitive streaming baselines trained with different latency budgets.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "2dbe78aa516cc911a71ff333a35a5ce0b1a49640", "arXivId": "2106.09760", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09760.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Kwangyoun Kim", "Felix Wu", "Prashant Sridhar", "Kyu J.
