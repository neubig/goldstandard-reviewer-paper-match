{"title": "Deep Recurrent Networks for Separation and Recognition of Single-Channel Speech in Nonstationary Background Audio", "abstract": "We investigate the use of deep neural networks and deep recurrent neural networks for separation and recognition of speech in challenging environments. Mask prediction networks received considerable interest recently for speech separation and speech enhancement problems where the background signals are nonstationary and challenging. Initial signal-level enhancement with deep neural networks has also been shown to be useful for noise-robust speech recognition in these environments. We consider using various loss functions for training the networks and illustrate differences among them. We compare the performance of deep computational architectures with conventional statistical techniques as well as variants of nonnegative matrix factorization, and establish that one can achieve impressively superior results with deep-learning-based techniques on this problem.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "91d98b0a175237b48122e7560010e87a968fb6e0", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Hakan Erdogan", "J.
