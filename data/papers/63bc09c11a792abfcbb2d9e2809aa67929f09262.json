{"title": "Learning Word Subsumption Projections for the Russian Language", "abstract": "The semantic relations of hypernymy and hyponymy are widely used in various natural language processing tasks for modelling the subsumptions in common sense reasoning. Since the popularisation of the distributional semantics, a significant attention is paid to applying word embeddings for inducing the relations between words. In this paper, we show our preliminary results on adopting the projection learning technique for computing hypernyms from hyponyms using word embeddings. We also conduct a series of experiments on the Russian language and release the open source software for learning hyponym-hypernym projections using both CPUs and GPUs, implemented with the TensorFlow machine learning framework.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "63bc09c11a792abfcbb2d9e2809aa67929f09262", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Dmitry Ustalov", "Alexander Panchenko"]}
