{"title": "A Graphical Framework for Contextual Search and Name Disambiguation in Email", "abstract": "A canopy for mounting over articles to be protected (vegetables). It includes a U-shape main frame having stakes for driving into the ground at a building, and shield including bows, cooperating with the main frame, carrying a flexible covering. The shield extends to one side of the main frame, forming a cantilever construction. The bows can be folded into position in essentially the plane of the main frame. Securing means is provided for tying the bows in a pack with the main frame, and for anchoring the canopy to the wall of the building. The canopy can be mounted free of a building, by driving the stakes into the ground, and a pair of them can be mounted in back-to-back position, with the shields extending in opposite directions away from each other, and the securing means can be interconnected to anchor the pair together, for mutual support.", "year": 2006, "ssId": "16457c13a40aa589fa06d8533a47b3f96aede474", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Einat Minkov", "William W.
