{"title": "Simple and Effective Paraphrastic Similarity from Parallel Translations", "abstract": "We present a model and methodology for learning paraphrastic sentence embeddings directly from bitext, removing the time-consuming intermediate step of creating para-phrase corpora. Further, we show that the resulting model can be applied to cross lingual tasks where it both outperforms and is orders of magnitude faster than more complex state-of-the-art baselines.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "86d84c1c9b0a500f930696ab27c83a4b30477560", "arXivId": "1909.13872", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13872.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["J.
