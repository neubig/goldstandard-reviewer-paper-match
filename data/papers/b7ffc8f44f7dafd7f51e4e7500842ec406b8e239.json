{"title": "Words or Characters? Fine-grained Gating for Reading Comprehension", "abstract": "Previous work combines word-level and character-level representations using concatenation or scalar weighting, which is suboptimal for high-level tasks like reading comprehension. We present a fine-grained gating mechanism to dynamically combine word-level and character-level representations based on properties of the words. We also extend the idea of fine-grained gating to modeling the interaction between questions and paragraphs for reading comprehension. Experiments show that our approach can improve the performance on reading comprehension tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the Children's Book Test dataset. To demonstrate the generality of our gating mechanism, we also show improved results on a social media tag prediction task.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "b7ffc8f44f7dafd7f51e4e7500842ec406b8e239", "arXivId": "1611.01724", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01724.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Zhilin Yang", "Bhuwan Dhingra", "Ye Yuan", "Junjie Hu", "William W.
