{"title": "A Robust Augmented Nodal Analysis Approach to Distribution Network Solution", "abstract": "The ambition to decarbonize the source of energy for heat and transport sector through electricity from renewable energy has led to significant challenge in the way power distribution networks (DNs) are planned, designed and operated. Traditionally, DN was put in place to support the demand passively. Now with renewable generation, storage and demand side management through automation, provision of network support services have transformed the character of the DNs. Active management of the DN requires fast power flow analysis, state estimation, reactive power support etc. This paper proposes a method of power flow analysis which incorporates the challenges of distributed generator (DG) characteristics, demand side management and voltage support. The proposed approach reformulated the Jacobian matrix of the well-known modified augmented nodal analysis (MANA) method; thus, improving the robustness and solvability of the formulation. Reactive powers of the DGs, node voltages and currents of \u2018non-constitutive\u2019 elements were the chosen state variables. The performance of this method is compared with the MANA. Results are discussed and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with two example case studies.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "f491a5f09ee01436d772a6cff25f22d700d8c9c0", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Onyema S.
