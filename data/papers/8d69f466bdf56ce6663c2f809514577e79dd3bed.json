{"title": "Gesture controlled environment using sixth sense technology and its implementation in IoT", "abstract": "This paper proposes an idea of building an interface to merge the existing technologies like Image processing, Internet of Things, Sixth sense, etc. at one place to reduce the hardware restrictions imposed on a user and improve the responsiveness of the system. The wearable device comprises of a camera, a projector, and its own gesture-controlled environment having smart tools based on trending techniques like gesture recognition, color marker detection, and speech recognition. The interface is trained using machine learning. It is also interfaced with an IoT based lab to access the lab controls remotely, enhance the security, and to connect devices present in the lab.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "8d69f466bdf56ce6663c2f809514577e79dd3bed", "arXivId": "2004.12217", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12217.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["S.
