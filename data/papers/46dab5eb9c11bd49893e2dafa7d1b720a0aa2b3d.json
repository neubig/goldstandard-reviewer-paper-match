{"title": "W ORDS OR C HARACTERS ? F INE-GRAINED", "abstract": "Previous work combines word-level and character-level representations using concatenation or scalar weighting, which is suboptimal for high-level tasks like reading comprehension. We present a fine-grained gating mechanism to dynamically combine word-level and character-level representations based on properties of the words. We also extend the idea of fine-grained gating to modeling the interaction between questions and paragraphs for reading comprehension. Experiments show that our approach can improve the performance on reading comprehension tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the Children\u2019s Book Test and Who Did What datasets. To demonstrate the generality of our gating mechanism, we also show improved results on a social media tag prediction task.1", "year": 2017, "ssId": "46dab5eb9c11bd49893e2dafa7d1b720a0aa2b3d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Zhilin Yang", "Bhuwan Dhingra", "Ye Yuan", "Junjie Hu", "William W.
