{"title": "Stacked Graphical Learning : Learning in Markov Random Fields using Very Short Inhomogeneous Markov Chains", "abstract": "We described stacked graphical learning, a meta-learning scheme in which a base learner is augmented by expanding one instance\u2019s features with predictions on other related instances. The stacked graphical learning is efficient, especially during inference, capable of capturing dependencies easily, and can be constructed based on any kind of base learner. In experiments on two classification problems, stacked graphical learning generally achieved comparable accuracy to other graphical models via much faster inference.", "year": 2006, "ssId": "a96e05353032cc6f3d72eb5eca192295beac065e", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
