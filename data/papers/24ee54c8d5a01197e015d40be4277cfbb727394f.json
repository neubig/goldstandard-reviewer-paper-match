{"title": "B&B: Planning Bus Routes with Sharing-bikes in the City", "abstract": "Recently, the emergence of sharing-bikes exerts a significant impact on citizens\u2019 daily travel. However, when planning bus routes, the current system still does not take them into consideration. In this paper, we propose B&B, a data-driven system to plan bus routes with the consideration of sharingbikes. Aiming to maximize the travel flow coverage, we design a heuristic approach to extend bus routes. Meanwhile, we propose a function to determine whether a road segment should be designed as a bus route or it is more suitable for passengers to ride sharing-bikes in that area. Moreover, to ensure the efficiency of bus routes, a constraint is set up on the directness of bus routes. Extensive evaluation of two large-scale datasets in New York City demonstrates that our system achieves the best coverage on both flows and areas, which outperform by 7.05% and 15.55% over the baselines without consider sharing-bikes. Our system lays a solid foundation for planners to plan the city transportation systems overall, especially concerning the design of the bus routes and sharing-bike lanes.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "24ee54c8d5a01197e015d40be4277cfbb727394f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yue Yu", "Tong Xia", "Yong Li"]}
