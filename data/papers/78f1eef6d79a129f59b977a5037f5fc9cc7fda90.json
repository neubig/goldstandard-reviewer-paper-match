{"title": "Principled Methods to Improve Peer Review", "abstract": "There is an urgent need to improve peer review, particularly due to the explosion in the number of submissions especially at ML and AI venues. Peer review faces a number of challenges including noise, calibration, subjectivity, and strategic behavior. This paper presents a survey of our recent works towards addressing these challenges. Our works take a principled approach to tackle these issues, towards developing an algorithmic toolkit for improved peer-review processes. Our algorithms focus on achieving objectives of fairness, accuracy, and robustness in these goals. We supplement our algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees as well as empirical evaluations on conference data. The ideas, results, and insights of this work as applicable broadly to a variety of applications beyond peer review.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "78f1eef6d79a129f59b977a5037f5fc9cc7fda90", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nihar B.
