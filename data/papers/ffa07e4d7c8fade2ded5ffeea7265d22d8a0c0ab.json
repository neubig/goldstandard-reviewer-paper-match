{"title": "Potential Practical Applications of Basic Neural Networks", "abstract": "3D construction methods are usually based on expensive furniture using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). Therefore, some people interested in this region are unable to put a practice on construction. Fortunately, some neural networks designed for image processing are ideal tools to balance the cost and gain. Combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a generative neural network (GAN) provides 3D constructionlovers an easy way to start. The two essential steps, cut images and construct models, use an independent network to provide the best result. To have a numerical understanding of the difference between our constructed model and ground truth, we also introduced the Hausdorff Distance to evaluate the model performance.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "ffa07e4d7c8fade2ded5ffeea7265d22d8a0c0ab", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Jincheng Lyu", "Yue Yu"]}
