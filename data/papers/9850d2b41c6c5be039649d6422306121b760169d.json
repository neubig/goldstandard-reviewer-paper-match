{"title": "Optimal Oblivious Updates in Distributed Storage Networks", "abstract": "Constructing truly distributed computer systems requires eliminating central control from several system operations. One such critical module is of updating data. In distributed storage systems, storage nodes intermittently go offline for various reasons. Upon coming back online, nodes need to update their contents to reflect any modifications to the data in the interim. We consider the problem of designing codes and update protocols where a stale node can be updated by downloading data from already updated nodes without requiring the system to store any additional information about the updates (such as previous versions of the data or a log of which data symbols were updated). We term such an update as an oblivious update. We provide lower bounds on communication for oblivious updates under generic settings as well as when the codes are restricted to be Maximum-DistanceSeparable (MDS). We then present explicit codes and oblivious update algorithms for both settings that meet these bounds tightly, thus establishing optimality.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "9850d2b41c6c5be039649d6422306121b760169d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Preetum Nakkiran", "Nihar B.
