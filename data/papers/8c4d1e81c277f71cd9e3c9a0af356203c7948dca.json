{"title": "Leveraging End-to-End ASR for Endangered Language Documentation: An Empirical Study on Yol\u00f3xochitl Mixtec", "abstract": "\u201cTranscription bottlenecks\u201d, created by a shortage of effective human transcribers (i.e., transcriber shortage), are one of the main challenges to endangered language (EL) documentation. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been suggested as a tool to overcome such bottlenecks. Following this suggestion, we investigated the effectiveness for EL documentation of end-to-end ASR, which unlike Hidden Markov Model ASR systems, eschews linguistic resources but is instead more dependent on large-data settings. We open source a Yolox\u00f3chitl Mixtec EL corpus. First, we review our method in building an end-to-end ASR system in a way that would be reproducible by the ASR community. We then propose a novice transcription correction task and demonstrate how ASR systems and novice transcribers can work together to improve EL documentation. We believe this combinatory methodology would mitigate the transcription bottleneck and transcriber shortage that hinders EL documentation.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "8c4d1e81c277f71cd9e3c9a0af356203c7948dca", "arXivId": "2101.10877", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10877.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Jiatong Shi", "Jiatong Shi.
