{"title": "JTubeSpeech: corpus of Japanese speech collected from YouTube for speech recognition and speaker verification", "abstract": "In this paper, we construct a new Japanese speech corpus called \u201cJTubeSpeech.\u201d Although recent end-to-end learning requires largesize speech corpora, open-sourced such corpora for languages other than English have not yet been established. In this paper, we describe the construction of a corpus from YouTube videos and subtitles for speech recognition and speaker verification. Our method can automatically filter the videos and subtitles with almost no languagedependent processes. We consistently employ Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based techniques for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and a speaker variation-based method for automatic speaker verification (ASV). We build 1) a large-scale Japanese ASR benchmark with more than 1,300 hours of data and 2) 900 hours of data for Japanese ASV.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "594827fdb2047bc7be4ea2f0d2364f46d187247e", "arXivId": "2112.09323", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09323.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Shinnosuke Takamichi", "Ludwig Kurzinger", "Takaaki Saeki", "Sayaka Shiota", "Shinji Watanabe"]}
