{"title": "Neural Models for Reasoning over Multiple Mentions Using Coreference", "abstract": "Many problems in NLP require aggregating information from multiple mentions of the same entity which may be far apart in the text. Existing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layers are biased towards short-term dependencies and hence not suited to such tasks. We present a recurrent layer which is instead biased towards coreferent dependencies. The layer uses coreference annotations extracted from an external system to connect entity mentions belonging to the same cluster. Incorporating this layer into a state-of-the-art reading comprehension model improves performance on three datasets \u2013 Wikihop, LAMBADA and the bAbi AI tasks \u2013 with large gains when training data is scarce.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "d0fbae81d870bbfb34430654f70fd6a21e8bd1cc", "arXivId": "1804.05922", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05922.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Bhuwan Dhingra", "Qiao Jin", "Zhilin Yang", "William W.
