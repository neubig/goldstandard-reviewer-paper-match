{"title": "ExpBERT: Representation Engineering with Natural Language Explanations", "abstract": "Suppose we want to specify the inductive bias that married couples typically go on honeymoons for the task of extracting pairs of spouses from text. In this paper, we allow model developers to specify these types of inductive biases as natural language explanations. We use BERT fine-tuned on MultiNLI to \u201cinterpret\u201d these explanations with respect to the input sentence, producing explanation-guided representations of the input. Across three relation extraction tasks, our method, ExpBERT, matches a BERT baseline but with 3\u201320x less labeled data and improves on the baseline by 3\u201310 F1 points with the same amount of labeled data.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "bd49e66af9755e6138967eba6aeb37d8190d2b4f", "arXivId": "2005.01932", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01932.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Shikhar Murty", "Pang Wei Koh", "Percy Liang"]}
