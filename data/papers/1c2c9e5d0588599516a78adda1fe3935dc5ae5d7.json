{"title": "Improved rates for derivative free play in convex games", "abstract": "The influential work of Bravo et al. (2018) shows that derivative free play in strongly monotone games has complexity O(d/\u03b5), where \u03b5 is the target accuracy on the expected squared distance to the solution. This note shows that the efficiency estimate is actually O(d/\u03b5), which reduces to the known efficiency guarantee for the method in unconstrained optimization. The argument we present is elementary, simply interpreting the method as stochastic gradient play on a slightly perturbed strongly monotone game.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "1c2c9e5d0588599516a78adda1fe3935dc5ae5d7", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["D.
