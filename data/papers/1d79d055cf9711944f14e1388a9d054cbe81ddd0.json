{"title": "Semi-supervised discriminative language modeling for Turkish ASR", "abstract": "We present our work on semi-supervised learning of discriminative language models where the negative examples for sentences in a text corpus are generated using confusion models for Turkish at various granularities, specifically, word, sub-word, syllable and phone levels. We experiment with different language models and various sampling strategies to select competing hypotheses for training with a variant of the perceptron algorithm. We find that morph-based confusion models with a sample selection strategy aiming to match the error distribution of the baseline ASR system gives the best performance. We also observe that substituting half of the supervised training examples with those obtained in a semi-supervised manner gives similar results.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "1d79d055cf9711944f14e1388a9d054cbe81ddd0", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Arda \u00c7elebi", "H.
