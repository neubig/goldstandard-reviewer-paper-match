{"title": "Latent Relation Language Models", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Latent Relation Language Models (LRLMs), a class of language models that parameterizes the joint distribution over the words in a document and the entities that occur therein via knowledge graph relations. This model has a number of attractive properties: it not only improves language modeling performance, but is also able to annotate the posterior probability of entity spans for a given text through relations. Experiments demonstrate empirical improvements over both word-based language models and a previous approach that incorporates knowledge graph information. Qualitative analysis further demonstrates the proposed model's ability to learn to predict appropriate relations in context. 1", "year": 2019, "ssId": "88051a6dce3b67541d8096647da2f6d31daa9e9a", "arXivId": "1908.07690", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07690.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Hiroaki Hayashi", "Zecong Hu", "Chenyan Xiong", "Graham Neubig"]}
