{"title": "Numerical modeling of em pump efficiency", "abstract": "The pilot Molten lead-bismuth target circuit (TC-1) in University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) was designed for beam power of 1 MW accelerator driven system (ADS). The TC-1 is a liquid lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) circulation loop. Circulation of the liquid alloy is driven by an annular linear induction pump (ALIP). Experimental measurements of system parameters have yielded a surprisingly low pump efficiency of less than 1%. A numerical study of the pump efficiency has been conducted to determine which operational parameters are responsible for this low efficiency and to give insight into future EM pump design. The numerical study has entailed incorporating algorithms which calculated the EM body force into a commercial CFD code (FEMLab). The EM body forces were calculated using both simplified analytic expressions, as well as by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations.\u00a9 2006 ASME", "year": 2006, "ssId": "a8372f7cb2e482a455b06c3e47f65aec5c7a924b", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["D.
