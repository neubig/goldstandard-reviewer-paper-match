{"title": "Evaluating unsupervised learning for natural language processing tasks", "abstract": "The development of unsupervised learning methods for natural language processing tasks has become an important and popular area of research. The primary advantage of these methods is that they do not require annotated data to learn a model. However, this advantage makes them difficult to evaluate against a manually labeled gold standard. Using unsupervised part-of-speech tagging as our case study, we discuss the reasons that render this evaluation paradigm unsuitable for the evaluation of unsupervised learning methods. Instead, we argue that the rarely used in-context evaluation is more appropriate and more informative, as it takes into account the way these methods are likely to be applied. Finally, bearing the issue of evaluation in mind, we propose directions for future work in unsupervised natural language processing.", "year": 2011, "ssId": "9333d372ad3887e02029d2eab0dbc0c0478582c7", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andreas Vlachos"]}
