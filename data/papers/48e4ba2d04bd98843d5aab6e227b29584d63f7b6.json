{"title": "Towards Crowdsourcing and Cooperation in Linguistic Resources", "abstract": "Linguistic resources can be populated with data through the use of such approaches as crowdsourcing and gamification when motivated people are involved. However, current crowdsourcing genre taxonomies lack the concept of cooperation, which is the principal element of modern video games and may potentially drive the annotators' interest. This survey on crowdsourcing taxonomies and cooperation in linguistic resources provides recommendations on using cooperation in existent genres of crowdsourcing and an evidence of the efficiency of cooperation using a popular Russian linguistic resource created through crowdsourcing as an example.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "48e4ba2d04bd98843d5aab6e227b29584d63f7b6", "arXivId": "1408.4245", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.4245.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Dmitry Ustalov"]}
