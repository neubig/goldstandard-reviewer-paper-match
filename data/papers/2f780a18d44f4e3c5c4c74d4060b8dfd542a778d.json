{"title": "Investigating Sports Commentator Bias within a Large Corpus of American Football Broadcasts", "abstract": "Sports broadcasters inject drama into play-by-play commentary by building team and player narratives through subjective analyses and anecdotes. Prior studies based on small datasets and manual coding show that such theatrics evince commentator bias in sports broadcasts. To examine this phenomenon, we assemble FOOTBALL, which contains 1,455 broadcast transcripts from American football games across six decades that are automatically annotated with 250K player mentions and linked with racial metadata. We identify major confounding factors for researchers examining racial bias in FOOTBALL, and perform a computational analysis that supports conclusions from prior social science studies.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "2f780a18d44f4e3c5c4c74d4060b8dfd542a778d", "arXivId": "1909.03343", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03343.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Jack Merullo", "Luke Yeh", "Abram Handler", "Alvin Grissom II", "Brendan T.
