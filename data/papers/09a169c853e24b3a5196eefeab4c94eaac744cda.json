{"title": "Political Ideology Detection Using Recursive Neural Networks", "abstract": "An individual\u2019s words often reveal their political ideology. Existing automated techniques to identify ideology from text focus on bags of words or wordlists, ignoring syntax. Taking inspiration from recent work in sentiment analysis that successfully models the compositional aspect of language, we apply a recursive neural network (RNN) framework to the task of identifying the political position evinced by a sentence. To show the importance of modeling subsentential elements, we crowdsource political annotations at a phrase and sentence level. Our model outperforms existing models on our newly annotated dataset and an existing dataset.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "09a169c853e24b3a5196eefeab4c94eaac744cda", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Mohit Iyyer", "P.
