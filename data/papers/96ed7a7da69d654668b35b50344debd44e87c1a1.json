{"title": "Low-Resource Contextual Topic Identification on Speech", "abstract": "In topic identification (topic ID) on real-world unstructured audio, an audio instance of variable topic shifts is first broken into sequential segments, and each segment is independently classified. We first present a general purpose method for topic ID on spoken segments in low-resource languages, using a cascade of universal acoustic modeling, translation lexicons to English, and English-language topic classification. Next, instead of classifying each segment independently, we demonstrate that exploring the contextual dependencies across sequential segments can provide large improvements. In particular, we propose an attention-based contextual model which is able to leverage the contexts in a selective manner. We test both our contextual and non-contextual models on four LORELEI languages, and on all but one our attention-based contextual model significantly outperforms the context-independent models.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "96ed7a7da69d654668b35b50344debd44e87c1a1", "arXivId": "1807.06204", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06204.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Chunxi Liu", "Matthew Wiesner", "Shinji Watanabe", "Craig Harman", "J.
