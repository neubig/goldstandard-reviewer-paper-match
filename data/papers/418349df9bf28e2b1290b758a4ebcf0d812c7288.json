{"title": "The MultiRank Bootstrap Algorithm: Self-Supervised Political Blog Classification and Ranking Using Semi-Supervised Link Classification", "abstract": "We present a new semi-supervised learning algorithm for classifying political blogs in a blog network and ranking them within predicted classes. We test our algorithm on two datasets and achieve classification accuracy of 81.9% and 84.6% using only 2 seed blogs.", "year": 2008, "ssId": "418349df9bf28e2b1290b758a4ebcf0d812c7288", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Frank Lin", "William W.
