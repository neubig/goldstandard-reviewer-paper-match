{"title": "Recent Developments on Espnet Toolkit Boosted By Conformer", "abstract": "In this study, we present recent developments on ESPnet: End-to- End Speech Processing toolkit, which mainly involves a recently proposed architecture called Conformer, Convolution-augmented Transformer. This paper shows the results for a wide range of end- to-end speech processing applications, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translations (ST), speech separation (SS) and text-to-speech (TTS). Our experiments reveal various training tips and significant performance benefits obtained with the Conformer on different tasks. These results are competitive or even outperform the current state-of-art Transformer models. We are preparing to release all-in-one recipes using open source and publicly available corpora for all the above tasks with pre-trained models. Our aim for this work is to contribute to our research community by reducing the burden of preparing state-of-the-art research environments usually requiring high resources.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "8809d0732f6147d4ad9218c8f9b20227c837a746", "arXivId": "2010.13956", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13956.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Pengcheng Guo", "Florian Boyer", "Xuankai Chang", "Tomoki Hayashi", "Yosuke Higuchi", "H.
