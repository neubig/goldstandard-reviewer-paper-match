{"title": "High-accuracy user identification using EEG biometrics", "abstract": "We analyze brain waves acquired through a consumer-grade EEG device to investigate its capabilities for user identification and authentication. First, we show the statistical significance of the P300 component in event-related potential (ERP) data from 14-channel EEGs across 25 subjects. We then apply a variety of machine learning techniques, comparing the user identification performance of various different combinations of a dimensionality reduction technique followed by a classification algorithm. Experimental results show that an identification accuracy of 72% can be achieved using only a single 800 ms ERP epoch. In addition, we demonstrate that the user identification accuracy can be significantly improved to more than 96.7% by joint classification of multiple epochs.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "e40a5c25d39d0f9add6a26c82613cf29edbcccf5", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["T.
