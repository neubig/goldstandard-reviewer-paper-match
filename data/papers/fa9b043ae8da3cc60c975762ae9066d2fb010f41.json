{"title": "Graph clustering for natural language processing", "abstract": "Graph-based representations are proven to be an effective approach for a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Graph clustering makes it possible to extract useful knowledge by exploiting the implicit structure of the data. In this tutorial, we will present several efficient graph clustering algorithms, show their strengths and weaknesses as well as their implementations and applications. Then, the evaluation methodology in unsupervised NLP tasks will be discussed.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "fa9b043ae8da3cc60c975762ae9066d2fb010f41", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Dmitry Ustalov"]}
