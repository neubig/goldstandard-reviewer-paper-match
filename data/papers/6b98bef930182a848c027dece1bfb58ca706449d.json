{"title": "Improving End-to-end Speech Recognition with Pronunciation-assisted Sub-word Modeling", "abstract": "Most end-to-end speech recognition systems model text directly as a sequence of characters or sub-words. Current approaches to sub-word extraction only consider character sequence frequencies, which at times produce inferior sub-word segmentation that might lead to erroneous speech recognition output. We propose pronunciation-assisted sub-word modeling (PASM), a sub-word extraction method that leverages the pronunciation information of a word. Experiments show that the proposed method can greatly improve upon the character-based baseline, and also outperform commonly used byte-pair encoding methods.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "6b98bef930182a848c027dece1bfb58ca706449d", "arXivId": "1811.04284", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04284.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Hainan Xu", "Shuoyang Ding", "Shinji Watanabe"]}
