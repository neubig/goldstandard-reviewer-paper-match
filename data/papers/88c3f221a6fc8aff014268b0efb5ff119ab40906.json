{"title": "Dataset Analysis and Augmentation for Emoji-Sensitive Irony Detection", "abstract": "Irony detection is an important task with applications in identification of online abuse and harassment. With the ubiquitous use of non-verbal cues such as emojis in social media, in this work we aim to study the role of these structures in irony detection. Since the existing irony detection datasets have <10% ironic tweets with emoji, classifiers trained on them are insensitive to emojis. We propose an automated pipeline for creating a more balanced dataset.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "88c3f221a6fc8aff014268b0efb5ff119ab40906", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Shirley Anugrah Hayati", "Aditi Chaudhary", "Naoki Otani", "A.
