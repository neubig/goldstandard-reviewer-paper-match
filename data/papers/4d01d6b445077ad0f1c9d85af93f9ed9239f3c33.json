{"title": "POS Tagging for Historical Texts with Sparse Training Data", "abstract": "This paper presents a method for part-ofspeech tagging of historical data and evaluates it on texts from different corpora of historical German (15th\u201318th century). Spelling normalization is used to preprocess the texts before applying a POS tagger trained on modern German corpora. Using only 250 manually normalized tokens as training data, the tagging accuracy of a manuscript from the 15th century can be raised from 28.65% to 74.89%.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "4d01d6b445077ad0f1c9d85af93f9ed9239f3c33", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Marcel Bollmann"]}
