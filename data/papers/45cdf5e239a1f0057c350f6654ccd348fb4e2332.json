{"title": "Stable Matching with Uncertain Linear Preferences", "abstract": "We consider the two-sided stable matching setting in which there may be uncertainty about the agents\u2019 preferences due to limited information or communication. We consider three models of uncertainty: (1) lottery model \u2014 in which for each agent, there is a probability distribution over linear preferences, (2) compact indifference model \u2014 for each agent, a weak preference order is specified and each linear order compatible with the weak order is equally likely and (3) joint probability model \u2014 there is a lottery over preference profiles. For each of the models, we study the computational complexity of computing the stability probability of a given matching as well as finding a matching with the highest probability of being stable. We also examine more restricted problems such as deciding whether a certainly stable matching exists. We find a rich complexity landscape for these problems, indicating that the form uncertainty takes is significant.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "45cdf5e239a1f0057c350f6654ccd348fb4e2332", "arXivId": "1607.02917", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02917.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["H.
