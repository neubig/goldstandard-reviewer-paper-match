{"title": "Application of topic tracking model to language model adaptation and meeting analysis", "abstract": "In a real environment, acoustic and language features often vary depending on the speakers, speaking styles and topic changes. This paper focuses on changes in the language environment, and applies a topic tracking model to language model adaptation for speech recognition and topic word extraction for meeting analysis. The topic tracking model can adaptively track changes in topics based on current text information and previously estimated topic models in an online manner. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown experimentally by the improvement in speech recognition performance achieved with the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese and by providing appropriate topic information in an automatic meeting analyzer.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "8b608ad2ec6d0300b6a0bb8f616d4a2b01150693", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Shinji Watanabe", "Tomoharu Iwata", "Takaaki Hori", "A.
