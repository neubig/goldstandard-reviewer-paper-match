{"title": "MuSiQue: Multi-hop Questions via Single-hop Question Composition", "abstract": "To build challenging multi-hop question answering datasets, we propose a bottom-up semi-automatic process of constructing multihop question via composition of single-hop questions. Constructing multi-hop questions as composition of single-hop questions allows us to exercise greater control over the quality of the resulting multi-hop questions. This process allows building a dataset with (i) connected reasoning where each step needs the answer from a previous step; (ii) minimal traintest leakage by eliminating even partial overlap of reasoning steps; (iii) variable number of hops and composition structures; and (iv) contrasting unanswerable questions by modifying the context. We use this process to construct a new multihop QA dataset: MuSiQue-Ans with 25K 2-4 hop questions using seed questions from 5 existing single-hop datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MuSiQue-Ans is challenging for state-of-the-art QA models (e.g., human-machine gap of 30 F1 pts), significantly harder than existing datasets (2x humanmachine gap), and substantially less cheatable (e.g., a single-hop model is worse by 30 F1 pts). We also build an even more challenging dataset, MuSiQue-Full, consisting of answerable and unanswerable contrast question pairs, where model performance drops further by 13+ F1 pts.1", "year": 2021, "ssId": "7e358ffc2731a82420d84a7f0bedb155a487c39d", "arXivId": "2108.00573", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00573.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["H.
