{"title": "Comparison of Grounding Grid Parameters Between Copper and Galvanized Flat Steel", "abstract": "In the intelligent substation, the shell of the secondary equipment is connected to the ground grid locally. When the short circuit fault current is injected into the grounding grid to cause the ground potential rise, the potential difference between the two points of the grounding grid will affect the normal operation of the secondary equipment. In this paper, aiming at the grounding grid of a 220kV substation, the grounding impedance, ground potential rise and ground potential difference between galvanized flat steel and copper grounding grid are calculated by using CDEGS software. The results show that the copper ground grid has a significant effect on reducing the potential difference of the ground grid.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "9336a2ff833d0b4bc914e2282ad04e19d27bc2be", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yue Yu", "Yanjun Li", "Dehong Wang", "Rongtian Du", "C.
