{"title": "Active Sensing for Markov Chain Tracking", "abstract": "Motivated by the need for energy-efficient operation in distributed tracking systems, the problem of active sensing for tracking a Markov chain is considered. A collection of wireless sensors form a multi-hop network, and collaboratively estimates the process at each node via measurements made locally and the messages received from neighbouring nodes. The trade-off is between the number of active sensors and the mean-squared error in the estimates averaged over the sensors, in presence of computing and communication constraints. To this end, a low-complexity, distributed sensor subset selection algorithm for tracking a Markov chain is proposed. The algorithm artfully blends three key tools: Gibbs sampling for sensor subset selection, stochastic approximation to meet the sensor activation constraint, and Kalman-consensus filtering for process estimation. The algorithm is numerically evaluated against natural competing algorithms, and is observed to yield significant improvement in the error performance despite using limited side information.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "a1340029d8a5c57bee8a5995ac3beafd3d0ba96c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Arpan Chattopadhyay", "U.
