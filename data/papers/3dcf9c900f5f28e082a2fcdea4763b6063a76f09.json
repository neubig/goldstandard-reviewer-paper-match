{"title": "Think about it! Improving defeasible reasoning by first modeling the question scenario.", "abstract": "Defeasible reasoning is the mode of reasoning where conclusions can be overturned by taking into account new evidence. Existing cognitive science literature on defeasible reasoning suggests that a person forms a \u201cmental model\u201d of the problem scenario before answering questions. Our research goal asks whether neural models can similarly benefit from envisioning the question scenario before answering a defeasible query. Our approach is, given a question, to have a model first create a graph of relevant influences, and then leverage that graph as an additional input when answering the question. Our system, CURIOUS, achieves a new state-of-the-art on three different defeasible reasoning datasets. This result is significant as it illustrates that performance can be improved by guiding a system to \u201cthink about\u201d a question and explicitly model the scenario, rather than answering reflexively.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "3dcf9c900f5f28e082a2fcdea4763b6063a76f09", "arXivId": "2110.12349", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.12349.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Aman Madaan", "Niket Tandon", "Dheeraj Rajagopal", "Peter Clark", "Yiming Yang", "E.
