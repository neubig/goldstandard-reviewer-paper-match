{"title": "Semantic-aware Spatio-temporal App Usage Representation via Graph Convolutional Network", "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a rapid proliferation of personalized mobile Apps, which poses a pressing need for user experience improvement. A promising solution is to model App usage by learning semantic-aware App usage representations which can capture the relation among time, locations and Apps. However, it is non-trivial due to the complexity, dynamics, and heterogeneity characteristics of App usage. To smooth over these obstacles and achieve the goal, we propose SA-GCN, a novel representation learning model to map Apps, location, and time units into dense embedding vectors considering spatio-temporal characteristics and unit properties simultaneously. To handle complexity and dynamics, we build an App usage graph by regarding App, time, and location units as nodes and their co-occurrence relations as edges. For heterogeneity, we develop a Graph Convolutional Network with meta path-based objective function to combine the structure of the graph and the attribute of units into the semantic-aware representations. We evaluate the performance of SA-GCN via a large-scale real-world dataset. In-depth analysis shows that SA-GCN characterizes the complex relationships among different units and recover meaningful spatio-temporal patterns. Moreover, we make use of the learned representations in App usage prediction task without post-training and achieve 8.3% of the performance gain compared with state-of-the-art baselines.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "890317710697a9e41d0d9961d99986c4d865393f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yue Yu", "Tong Xia", "Huandong Wang", "Jie Feng", "Yong Li"]}
