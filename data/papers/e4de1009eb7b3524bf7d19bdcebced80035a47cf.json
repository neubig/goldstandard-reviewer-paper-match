{"title": "Asynchronous and noncoherent neighbor discovery for the IoT using sparse-graph codes", "abstract": "In this paper, we design a fast and efficient energy-based and asynchronous neighbor discovery protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). In our solution, we relax the assumption of frame-level synchronization. We formulate a novel asynchronous group testing scheme and apply it to the neighbor discovery problem. We then show that our proposed scheme is able to detect the set of K active neighbors1 among a network of n nodes with codeword length and decoding complexity of \u0398(K log (K) log (n)). Finally, we provide extensive simulation results to verify our theoretical guarantees.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "e4de1009eb7b3524bf7d19bdcebced80035a47cf", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kabir Chandrasekher", "Kangwook Lee", "P.
