{"title": "Good Semi-supervised Learning That Requires a Bad GAN", "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) obtained strong empirical results, but it is not clear 1) how the discriminator benefits from joint training with a generator, and 2) why good semi-supervised classification performance and a good generator cannot be obtained at the same time. Theoretically, we show that given the discriminator objective, good semisupervised learning indeed requires a bad generator, and propose the definition of a preferred generator. Empirically, we derive a novel formulation based on our analysis that substantially improves over feature matching GANs, obtaining state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "3c57a1aa483d8bffe1339914b80d2913f2dc8376", "arXivId": "1705.09783", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09783.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Zihang Dai", "Zhilin Yang", "Fan Yang", "William W.
