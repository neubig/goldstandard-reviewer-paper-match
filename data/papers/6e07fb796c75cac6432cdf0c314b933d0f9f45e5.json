{"title": "From gene names to actual genes", "abstract": "A common task in biomedical text mining is the recognition of gene names. In many applications though, it is important to know whether a gene name refers to the actual gene or to an entity related to it. This paper presents a trainable system to perform this task. It combines syntactic parsing with SVMs and achieves 78.63% accuracy. The training data used were generated automatically by a simple rule-based tagger. Such an approach can be useful to other fields which exhibit similar ambiguity in the way names are used to refer to entities.", "year": 2007, "ssId": "6e07fb796c75cac6432cdf0c314b933d0f9f45e5", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ioannis Korkontzelos", "Andreas Vlachos", "Ian Lewin"]}
