{"title": "Removing the Training Wheels: A Coreference Dataset that Entertains Humans and Challenges Computers", "abstract": "Coreference is a core nlp problem. However, newswire data, the primary source of existing coreference data, lack the richness necessary to truly solve coreference. We present a new domain with denser references\u2014quiz bowl questions\u2014that is challenging and enjoyable to humans, and we use the quiz bowl community to develop a new coreference dataset, together with an annotation framework that can tag any text data with coreferences and named entities. We also successfully integrate active learning into this annotation pipeline to collect documents maximally useful to coreference models. State-of-the-art coreference systems underperform a simple classifier on our new dataset, motivating non-newswire data for future coreference research.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "d9d0d908e3f652ee350f4919d4c2ab972ada1ca4", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Anupam Guha", "Mohit Iyyer", "D.
