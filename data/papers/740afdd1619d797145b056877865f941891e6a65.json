{"title": "Decision-Dependent Risk Minimization in Geometrically Decaying Dynamic Environments", "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of expected loss minimization given a data distribution that is dependent on the decision-maker\u2019s action and evolves dynamically in time according to a geometric decay process. Novel algorithms for both the information setting in which the decision-maker has a \ufb01rst or- der gradient oracle and the setting in which they have simply a loss function oracle are are introduced. The algorithms operate on the same underlying principle: the decision-maker repeatedly deploys a \ufb01xed decision repeatedly over the length of an epoch, thereby allowing the dynamically changing environment to suf\ufb01ciently mix before updating the decision. The iteration complexity in each of the settings is shown to match existing rates for \ufb01rst and zero order stochastic gradient meth- ods up to logarithmic factors. The algorithms are evaluated on a \u201csemi-synthetic\u201d example using real world data from the SFpark dynamic pricing pilot study; it is shown that the announced prices result in an improvement for the institution\u2019s objective (target occupancy), while achieving an overall re-duction in parking rates.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "740afdd1619d797145b056877865f941891e6a65", "arXivId": "2204.08281", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08281.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Mitas Ray", "D.
