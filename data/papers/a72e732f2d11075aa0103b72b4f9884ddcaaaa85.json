{"title": "Polynomial learnability and Inductive Logic Programming: Methods and results", "abstract": "Over the last few years, the efficient learnability of logic programs has been studied extensively. Positive and negative learnability results now exist for a number of restricted classes of logic programs that are closely related to the classes used in practice within inductive logic programming. This paper surveys these results, and also introduces some of the more useful techniques for deriving such results. The paper does not assume any prior background in computational learning theory.", "year": 1995, "ssId": "a72e732f2d11075aa0103b72b4f9884ddcaaaa85", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
