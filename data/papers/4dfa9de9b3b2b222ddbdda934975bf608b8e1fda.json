{"title": "DeliData: A dataset for deliberation in multi-party problem solving", "abstract": "Dialogue systems research is traditionally focused on dialogues between two interlocutors, largely ignoring group conversations. Moreover, most previous research is focused either on task-oriented dialogue (e.g. restaurant bookings) or user engagement (chatbots), while research on systems for collaborative dialogues is an under-explored area. To this end, we introduce the first publicly available dataset containing collaborative conversations on solving a cognitive task, consisting of 500 group dialogues and 14k utterances. Furthermore, we propose a novel annotation schema that captures deliberation cues and release 50 dialogues annotated with it. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the annotated data in training classifiers to predict the constructiveness of a conversation. The data collection platform, dataset and annotated corpus are publicly available at https://delibot.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "4dfa9de9b3b2b222ddbdda934975bf608b8e1fda", "arXivId": "2108.05271", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05271.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Georgi Karadzhov", "Tom Stafford", "Andreas Vlachos"]}
