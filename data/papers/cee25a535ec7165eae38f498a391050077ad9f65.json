{"title": "A sampling-based speaker clustering using utterance-oriented Dirichlet process mixture model and its evaluation on large-scale data", "abstract": "An infinite mixture model is applied to model-based speaker clustering with sampling-based optimization to make it possible to estimate the number of speakers. For this purpose, a framework of non-parametric Bayesian modeling is implemented with the Markov chain Monte Carlo and incorporated in the utterance-oriented speaker model. The proposed model is called the utterance-oriented Dirichlet process mixture model (UO-DPMM). The present paper demonstrates that UO-DPMM is successfully applied on large-scale data and outperforms the conventional hierarchical agglomerative clustering, especially for large amounts of utterances.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "cee25a535ec7165eae38f498a391050077ad9f65", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Naohiro Tawara", "Tetsuji Ogawa", "Shinji Watanabe", "A.
