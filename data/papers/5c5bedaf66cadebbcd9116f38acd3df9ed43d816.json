{"title": "Seismic Time-Frequency Analysis Based on Entropy-Optimized Paul Wavelet Transform", "abstract": "A new method of time-frequency analysis called the entropy-optimized Paul wavelet transform (WT) (EOPWT), is carried out with the use of Paul wavelet-based continuous WT (CWT) on seismic data with the help of the R\u00e9nyi entropy measurement. Despite its complicated formulation and not being physically intuitive, we extend the parameter definition of Paul wavelet to the real-valued domain, where we demonstrate its superiority over commonly used wavelet functions because of its flexibility in controlling the time-frequency resolution. It can be even regarded as a generalized waveform or an alternative choice with respect to both Ricker and Morlet wavelets. Synthetic seismic trace analysis shows that EOPWT objectively produces a more compact representation of time-frequency localization than other conventional tools in capturing the nonlinear and nonstationary features of input signals. It also offers new possibilities in yielding more reliable seismic attributes in the field of reservoir characterization. We implement spectral decomposition using the proposed method upon a data set from a deeply buried carbonate gas reservoir in southwestern China. Combining the energy absorption analysis method, we obtain the attenuation gradient attribute section indicating gas accumulation. The field data example demonstrates the effectiveness of direct hydrocarbon detection using EOPWT.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "5c5bedaf66cadebbcd9116f38acd3df9ed43d816", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yi Luan", "Yucheng Huang", "Xiaodong Zheng", "J.
