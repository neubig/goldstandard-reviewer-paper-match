{"title": "Precise Recovery of Latent Vectors from Generative Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) transform latent vectors into visually plausible images. It is generally thought that the original GAN formulation gives no out-of-the-box method to reverse the mapping, projecting images back into latent space. We introduce a simple, gradient-based technique called stochastic clipping. In experiments, for images generated by the GAN, we precisely recover their latent vector pre-images 100% of the time. Additional experiments demonstrate that this method is robust to noise. Finally, we show that even for unseen images, our method appears to recover unique encodings.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "7506626f776f211afac2c2d1138aca0e0479e5c3", "arXivId": "1702.04782", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.04782.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Zachary Chase Lipton", "Subarna Tripathi"]}
