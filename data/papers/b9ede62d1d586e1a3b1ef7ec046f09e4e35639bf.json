{"title": "Off the Beaten Path: Let's Replace Term-Based Retrieval with k-NN Search", "abstract": "Retrieval pipelines commonly rely on a term-based search to obtain candidate records, which are subsequently re-ranked. Some candidates are missed by this approach, e.g., due to a vocabulary mismatch. We address this issue by replacing the term-based search with a generic k-NN retrieval algorithm, where a similarity function can take into account subtle term associations. While an exact brute-force k-NN search using this similarity function is slow, we demonstrate that an approximate algorithm can be nearly two orders of magnitude faster at the expense of only a small loss in accuracy. A retrieval pipeline using an approximate k-NN search can be more effective and efficient than the term-based pipeline. This opens up new possibilities for designing effective retrieval pipelines. Our software (including data-generating code) and derivative data based on the Stack Overflow collection is available online.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "b9ede62d1d586e1a3b1ef7ec046f09e4e35639bf", "arXivId": "1610.10001", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.10001.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Leonid Boytsov", "David Novak", "Yury Malkov", "Eric Nyberg"]}
