{"title": "Information-Theoretically Secure Regenerating Codes for Distributed Storage", "abstract": "Regenerating codes are a class of codes for distributed storage networks that provide reliability and availability of data, and also perform efficient node repair. Another important aspect of a distributed storage network is its security. In this paper, we consider a threat model where an eavesdropper may gain access to the data stored in a subset of the storage nodes, and possibly also, to the data downloaded during repair of some nodes. We provide explicit constructions of regenerating codes that achieve information-theoretic secrecy capacity in this setting.", "year": 2011, "ssId": "8f99f9409f254134aa32fbf072475100f688d613", "arXivId": "1107.5279", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.5279.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Nihar B.
