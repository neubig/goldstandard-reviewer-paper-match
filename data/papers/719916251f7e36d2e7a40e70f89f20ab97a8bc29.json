{"title": "Student-Teacher Learning for BLSTM Mask-based Speech Enhancement", "abstract": "Spectral mask estimation using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) neural networks has been widely used in various speech enhancement applications, and it has achieved great success when it is applied to multichannel enhancement techniques with a mask-based beamformer. However, when these masks are used for single channel speech enhancement they severely distort the speech signal and make them unsuitable for speech recognition. This paper proposes a student-teacher learning paradigm for single channel speech enhancement. The beamformed signal from multichannel enhancement is given as input to the teacher network to obtain soft masks. An additional cross-entropy loss term with the soft mask target is combined with the original loss, so that the student network with single-channel input is trained to mimic the soft mask obtained with multichannel input through beamforming. Experiments with the CHiME-4 challenge single channel track data shows improvement in ASR performance.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "719916251f7e36d2e7a40e70f89f20ab97a8bc29", "arXivId": "1803.10013", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10013.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["A.
