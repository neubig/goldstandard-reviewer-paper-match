{"title": "A Framework and Tool for Collaborative Extraction of Reliable Information", "abstract": "This research proposes a framework for efficient information extraction and filtering in situations where 1) extreme reliability is important, 2) the amount of information to be combed through is massive, and 3) we can expect a relatively large number of human workers to be available. In particular, we are motivated by needs in times of crisis, and assume that in order to ensure the high level of reliability required, it will be necessary to have at least one human worker confirm all extracted information. Given this setting, we propose a method to improve the efficiency of manual verification by deciding which information to present to workers using machine learning techniques. Even given this efficient search framework, the amount of information on the internet is still too much for one user to handle, so we additionally create a web-based framework that allows for collaborative work, and an algorithm that allows for this framework to work on large data in real-time. We perform an evaluation using data from Twitter after the Great East Japan Earthquake, and compare efficiency using both traditional keyword search and the proposed learningbased method.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "c37c40db51ccfd6f93004e788102ede72578e5d8", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Graham Neubig", "Shinsuke Mori", "M.
