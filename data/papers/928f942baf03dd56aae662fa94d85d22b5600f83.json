{"title": "Searching Translation Memories for Paraphrases", "abstract": "Translation memories (TMs) are very useful tools for translating texts in narrow domains. We propose the use of paraphrases for searching TMs. By using paraphrases, we can retrieve sentences that have the same meaning as the input sentences even if they do not match exactly. The paraphrase pairs used in our system are obtained from parallel corpora and are used to retrieve sentences in a statistical framework.", "year": 2011, "ssId": "928f942baf03dd56aae662fa94d85d22b5600f83", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["M.
