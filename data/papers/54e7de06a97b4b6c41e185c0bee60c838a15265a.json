The proposed framework enables us to modify speech waveforms by manipulating unobserved articulatory parameters estimated in the inversion mapping and generating the modified speech waveforms from the manipulated articulatory parameters in the production mapping. We also propose an articulatory manipulation method that considers inter-dimensional correlation between articulators. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is capable of successfully modifying phoneme sounds by manually controlling related articulators.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "54e7de06a97b4b6c41e185c0bee60c838a15265a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Patrick Lumban Tobing", "T.
