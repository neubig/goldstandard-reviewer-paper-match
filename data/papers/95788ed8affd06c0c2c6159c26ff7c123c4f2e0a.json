{"title": "Neural Speaker Diarization with Speaker-Wise Chain Rule", "abstract": "Speaker diarization is an essential step for processing multi-speaker audio. Although an end-to-end neural diarization (EEND) method achieved state-of-the-art performance, it is limited to a fixed number of speakers. In this paper, we solve this fixed number of speaker issue by a novel speaker-wise conditional inference method based on the probabilistic chain rule. In the proposed method, each speaker's speech activity is regarded as a single random variable, and is estimated sequentially conditioned on previously estimated other speakers' speech activities. Similar to other sequence-to-sequence models, the proposed method produces a variable number of speakers with a stop sequence condition. We evaluated the proposed method on multi-speaker audio recordings of a variable number of speakers. Experimental results show that the proposed method can correctly produce diarization results with a variable number of speakers and outperforms the state-of-the-art end-to-end speaker diarization methods in terms of diarization error rate.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "95788ed8affd06c0c2c6159c26ff7c123c4f2e0a", "arXivId": "2006.01796", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01796.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yusuke Fujita", "Shinji Watanabe", "Shota Horiguchi", "Yawen Xue", "Jing Shi", "Kenji Nagamatsu"]}
