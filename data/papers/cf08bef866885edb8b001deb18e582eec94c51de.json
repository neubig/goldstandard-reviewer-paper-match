{"title": "The use of semantic and acoustic features for open-domain TED talk summarization", "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of automatic speech summarization on open-domain TED talks. The large vocabulary and diversity of topics from speaker-to-speaker presents significant difficulties. The challenges increase not only how to handle disfluencies and fillers, but also how to extract topic-related meaningful messages within the free talks. Here, we propose to incorporate semantic and acoustic features within the speech summarization technique. In addition, we also propose a new evaluation method for speech summarization by checking semantic similarity between system and human summarization. Experiments results reveal that the proposed methods are effective in spontaneous speech summarization.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "cf08bef866885edb8b001deb18e582eec94c51de", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Fajri Koto", "S.
