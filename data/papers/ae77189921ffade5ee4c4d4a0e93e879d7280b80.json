{"title": "Coalescing Narrative and Dialogue for Grounded Pose Forecasting", "abstract": "This research aims to create a data-driven end-to-end model for multimodal forecasting body pose and gestures of virtual avatars. A novel aspect of this research is to coalesce both narrative and dialogue for pose forecasting. In a narrative, language is used in a third person view to describe the avatar actions. In dialogue both first and second person views need to be integrated to accurately forecast avatar pose. Gestures and poses of a speaker are linked to other modalities: language and acoustics. We use these correlations to better predict the avatar\u2019s pose.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "ae77189921ffade5ee4c4d4a0e93e879d7280b80", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Chaitanya Ahuja"]}
