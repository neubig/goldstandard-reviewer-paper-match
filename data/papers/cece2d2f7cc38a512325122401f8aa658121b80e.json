{"title": "A Dialog System to Detect Deception", "abstract": "When humans attempt to detect deception, they perform two actions: looking for telltale signs of deception, and asking questions to attempt to unveil a deceptive conversational partner. There is a significant amount of prior work on automatic deception detection, which focuses on the former. On the other hand, we focus on the latter, constructing a dialog system that asks questions to attempt to catch a potentially deceptive conversation partner. We propose several dialog strategies for this task, and measure the deception detection accuracy of each, finding that a more intelligent dialog strategy is slightly more effective at detecting deception.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "cece2d2f7cc38a512325122401f8aa658121b80e", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yuiko Tsunomori", "Graham Neubig", "Takuya Hiraoka", "M.
