{"title": "Reinforcement Learning of Cooperative Persuasive Dialogue Policies using Framing", "abstract": "In this paper, we apply reinforcement learning for automatically learning cooperative persuasive dialogue system policies using framing, the use of emotionally charged statements common in persuasive dialogue between humans. In order to apply reinforcement learning, we describe a method to construct user simulators and reward functions specifically tailored to persuasive dialogue based on a corpus of persuasive dialogues between human interlocutors. Then, we evaluate the learned policy and the effect of framing through experiments both with a user simulator and with real users. The experimental evaluation indicates that applying reinforcement learning is effective for construction of cooperative persuasive dialogue systems which use framing.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "101d619b5911e9c2fda6f02365c593ae61617cb6", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Takuya Hiraoka", "Graham Neubig", "S.
