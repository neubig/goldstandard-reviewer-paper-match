{"title": "Entity Projection via Machine Translation for Cross-Lingual NER", "abstract": "Although over 100 languages are supported by strong off-the-shelf machine translation systems, only a subset of them possess large annotated corpora for named entity recognition. Motivated by this fact, we leverage machine translation to improve annotation-projection approaches to cross-lingual named entity recognition. We propose a system that improves over prior entity-projection methods by: (a) leveraging machine translation systems twice: first for translating sentences and subsequently for translating entities; (b) matching entities based on orthographic and phonetic similarity; and (c) identifying matches based on distributional statistics derived from the dataset. Our approach improves upon current state-of-the-art methods for cross-lingual named entity recognition on 5 diverse languages by an average of 4.1 points. Further, our method achieves state-of-the-art F_1 scores for Armenian, outperforming even a monolingual model trained on Armenian source data.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "00cc6deb3cf2c9281ddcf4875aad3ee14c92e52f", "arXivId": "1909.05356", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05356.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Alankar Jain", "Bhargavi Paranjape", "Zachary Chase Lipton"]}
