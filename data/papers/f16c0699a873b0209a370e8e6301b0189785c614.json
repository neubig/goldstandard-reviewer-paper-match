{"title": "Active Learning for Constrained Dirichlet Process Mixture Models", "abstract": "Recent work applied Dirichlet Process Mixture Models to the task of verb clustering, incorporating supervision in the form of must-links and cannot-links constraints between instances. In this work, we introduce an active learning approach for constraint selection employing uncertainty-based sampling. We achieve substantial improvements over random selection on two datasets.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "f16c0699a873b0209a370e8e6301b0189785c614", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andreas Vlachos", "Zoubin Ghahramani", "Ted Briscoe"]}
