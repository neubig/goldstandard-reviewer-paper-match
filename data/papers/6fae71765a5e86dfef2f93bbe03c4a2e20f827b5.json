{"title": "The NAIST English speech recognition system for IWSLT 2015", "abstract": "The International Workshop for Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) is an annual evaluation campaign for core speech processing technologies. This paper presents Nara Institute of Science and Technology\u2019s (NAIST\u2019s) contribution to the English automatic speech recognition (ASR) track for the 2015 evaluation campaign. The ASR systems presented in this paper make use of various frontends, varying deep neural net (DNN) acoustic models and separate language models for decoding and rescoring. Recognition is performed in three stages: Decoding, lattice rescoring and system combination via recognizer output voting error reduction (ROVER). We discuss the application of a rank-score based weighting approach for the system combination. Also, a Gaussian mixture model hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) based speech/non-speech segmenter makes use of said combination scheme. The primary submission achieves a word error rate (WER) of 9.5% and 10.1% on the official development set, given manual and automatic segmentation respectively.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "6fae71765a5e86dfef2f93bbe03c4a2e20f827b5", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Michael Heck", "Quoc Truong Do", "S.
