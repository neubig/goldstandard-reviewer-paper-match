{"title": "Structured retrieval using SOLR", "abstract": "This report presents SOLR Annographix: a software suite for indexing and querying annotation graphs generated by NLP pipelines. E ectiveness and e ciency of the software was evaluated in a document retrieval task for the purpose of factoid question answering (QA). To this end, we employed the AQUAINT text collection and TREC QA topics. The actual queries were generated from answer-bearing sentences using an approach of Bilotti [3]. Queries that included linguistically-motivated constraints outperformed unstructured queries: The di erences were substantial and statistically signi cant. In addition, we experimented with queries generated from randomly selected corpus sentences: It was possible to retrieve original documents in at least 90% of cases, while spending less than 0.1 sec per query (on average). These results are encouraging. Yet, the system needs to be improved by (1) implementing annotation compression, (2) extending the query language, (3) implementing better graph matching algorithms that would be less dependent on an early termination heuristic.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "7dce2877758b0103d1f7a454c184dc641e123359", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Leonid Boytsov"]}
