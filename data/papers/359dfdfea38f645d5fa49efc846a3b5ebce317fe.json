{"title": "The Doctor Just Won't Accept That!", "abstract": "Calls to arms to build interpretable models express a well-founded discomfort with machine learning. Should a software agent that does not even know what a loan is decide who qualifies for one? Indeed, we ought to be cautious about injecting machine learning (or anything else, for that matter) into applications where there may be a significant risk of causing social harm. However, claims that stakeholders \"just won't accept that!\" do not provide a sufficient foundation for a proposed field of study. For the field of interpretable machine learning to advance, we must ask the following questions: What precisely won't various stakeholders accept? What do they want? Are these desiderata reasonable? Are they feasible? In order to answer these questions, we'll have to give real-world problems and their respective stakeholders greater consideration.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "359dfdfea38f645d5fa49efc846a3b5ebce317fe", "arXivId": "1711.08037", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08037.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Zachary Chase Lipton"]}
