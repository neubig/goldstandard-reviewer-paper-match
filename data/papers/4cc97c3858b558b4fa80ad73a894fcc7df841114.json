{"title": "Model-Agnostic Characterization of Fairness Trade-offs", "abstract": "There exist several inherent trade-offs in designing a fair model, such as those between the model's predictive performance and fairness, or even among different notions of fairness. In practice, exploring these trade-offs requires significant human and computational resources. We propose a diagnostic that enables practitioners to explore these trade-offs without training a single model. Our work hinges on the observation that many widely-used fairness definitions can be expressed via the fairness-confusion tensor, an object obtained by splitting the traditional confusion matrix according to protected data attributes. Optimizing accuracy and fairness objectives directly over the elements in this tensor yields a data-dependent yet model-agnostic way of understanding several types of trade-offs. We further leverage this tensor-based perspective to generalize existing theoretical impossibility results to a wider range of fairness definitions. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed diagnostic on synthetic and real datasets.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "4cc97c3858b558b4fa80ad73a894fcc7df841114", "arXivId": "2004.03424", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03424.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Joon Sik Kim", "Jiahao Chen", "Ameet S.
