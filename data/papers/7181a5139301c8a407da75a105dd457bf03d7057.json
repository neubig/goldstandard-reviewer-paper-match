{"title": "A Primal-Dual Approach to Markovian Network Optimization", "abstract": "We formulate a novel class of stochastic network optimization problems, termed \\emph{Markovian network optimization}, as a primal-dual pair, whose solutions provide an dynamic stochastic extension to Wadrop equilibrium principle. We further generalize such network optimization to accommodate variable amount of flow and multi-commodity flows with heterogeneous planning time windows, features that are well-motivated in applications arise from game-theoretic settings. Finally, in order to solve the primal-dual pair, we design dynamic programming based numerical algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art commercial software (Gurobi) in extensive numerical experiments.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "7181a5139301c8a407da75a105dd457bf03d7057", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yue Yu", "Daniel J.
