{"title": "Consideration of wind parks operation in the optimal power flow problem", "abstract": "In this paper, a modification to the optimal power flow problem, which accounts for the presence of wind parks and independent power producers (IPP) operation under large-scale integration of dispatchable wind energy resource in the power system, is described. A successive linear programming approach is utilized for the solution of the problem.", "year": 1999, "ssId": "2a462e2b748d7e78f3af2621071265c1ad2683ea", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["G.
