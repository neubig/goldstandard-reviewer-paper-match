{"title": "Decoding billions of integers per second through vectorization", "abstract": "In many important applications\u2014such as search engines and relational database systems\u2014data are stored in the form of arrays of integers. Encoding and, most importantly, decoding of these arrays consumes considerable CPU\u2009time. Therefore, substantial effort has been made to reduce costs associated with compression and decompression. In particular, researchers have exploited the superscalar nature of modern processors and single\u2010instruction, multiple\u2010data (SIMD) instructions. Nevertheless, we introduce a novel vectorized scheme called SIMD\u2010BP128\u22c6 that improves over previously proposed vectorized approaches. It is nearly twice as fast as the previously fastest schemes on desktop processors (varint\u2010G8IU and PFOR). At the same time, SIMD\u2010BP128\u22c6 saves up to 2\u2009bits/int. For even better compression, we propose another new vectorized scheme (SIMD\u2010FastPFOR) that has a compression ratio within 10% of a state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art scheme (Simple\u20108b) while being two times faster during decoding. \u00a9 2013 The Authors.
