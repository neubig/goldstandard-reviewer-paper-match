{"title": "Unsupervised Labeled Parsing with Deep Inside-Outside Recursive Autoencoders", "abstract": "Understanding text often requires identifying meaningful constituent spans such as noun phrases and verb phrases. In this work, we show that we can effectively recover these types of labels using the learned phrase vectors from deep inside-outside recursive autoencoders (DIORA). Specifically, we cluster span representations to induce span labels. Additionally, we improve the model\u2019s labeling accuracy by integrating latent code learning into the training procedure. We evaluate this approach empirically through unsupervised labeled constituency parsing. Our method outperforms ELMo and BERT on two versions of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset and is competitive to prior work that requires additional human annotations, improving over a previous state-of-the-art system that depends on ground-truth part-of-speech tags by 5 absolute F1 points (19% relative error reduction).", "year": 2019, "ssId": "17c7c92db1f4ace842f9db6b44bfce264308b628", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andrew Drozdov", "Pat Verga", "Yi-Pei Chen", "Mohit Iyyer", "A.
