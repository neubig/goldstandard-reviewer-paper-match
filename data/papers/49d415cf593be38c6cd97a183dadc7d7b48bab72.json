{"title": "Quantifying the Impact of AI on Productivity and Labor Demand: Evidence from U.S. Census Microdata1", "abstract": "After decades of disappointment, artificial intelligence (AI) has entered a new era of rapidly advancing capabilities that are likely to raise productivity and reshape demand for labor within and across firms and industries. Accurately measuring these effects has been difficult due to a lack of detailed, firm-level data on AI innovation. We address that challenge by using a combination of machine learning algorithms to parse the text of U.S. patent grants and assess the degree to which they are AI-related. This approach indicates that AI-related invention is far more pervasive than previous analyses have suggested. We match our data on AI patenting to U.S. Census microdata collected on the innovating firms. We then perform an event study using these matched data to gauge the impact of these innovations on firm labor demand and firm growth. We find that AI-related innovations are positively associated with firm growth as firms with AI-related innovations have 25% faster employment growth and 40% faster revenue growth than a comparative set of firms. We also find evidence that AI-related innovations appear to raise output per worker and increase within-firm wage inequality. 1 Any opinions and conclusions expressed herein are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. Census Bureau or the National Bureau of Economic Research.
