{"title": "Science Fiction as an Introduction to AI Research", "abstract": "The undergraduate computer science curriculum is generally focused on skills and tools; most students are not exposed to much research in the field, and do not learn how to navigate the research literature. We describe how science fiction reviews were used as a gateway to research reviews. Students learn a little about current or recent research on a topic that stirs their imagination, and learn how to search for, read critically, and compare technical papers on a topic related their chosen science fiction book, movie, or TV show.", "year": 2011, "ssId": "ac5e7f9bbc5d46bebc4ec5616aba9d014a6d237f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["J.
