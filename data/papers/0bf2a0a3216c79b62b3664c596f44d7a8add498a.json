{"title": "Fiction as an Introduction to Computer Science Research", "abstract": "The undergraduate computer science curriculum is generally focused on skills and tools; most students are not exposed to much research in the field, and do not learn how to navigate the research literature. We describe how fiction reviews (and specifically science fiction) are used as a gateway to research reviews. Students learn a little about current or recent research on a topic that stirs their imagination, and learn how to search for, read critically, and compare technical papers on a topic related to their chosen science fiction book, movie, or TV show.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "0bf2a0a3216c79b62b3664c596f44d7a8add498a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["J.
