Abstract Recently there has been a trend toward increasing the capability of the in-vehicle interface in terms of access to information and complex controls. This has been accompanied by an increase in the complexity of the car Human Machine Interface [HMI]. At the same time, studies have shown that driver distraction can contribute to accidents. This paper provides some possible ways to reduce driver cognitive load by augmenting the interface.
