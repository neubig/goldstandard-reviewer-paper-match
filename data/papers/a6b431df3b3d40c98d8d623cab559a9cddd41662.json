{"title": "Schema-Guided Paradigm for Zero-Shot Dialog", "abstract": "Developing mechanisms that flexibly adapt dialog systems to unseen tasks and domains is a major challenge in dialog research. Neural models implicitly memorize task-specific dialog policies from the training data. We posit that this implicit memorization has precluded zero-shot transfer learning. To this end, we leverage the schema-guided paradigm, wherein the task-specific dialog policy is explicitly provided to the model. We introduce the Schema Attention Model (SAM) and improved schema representations for the STAR corpus. SAM obtains significant improvement in zero-shot settings, with a +22 F1 score improvement over prior work. These results validate the feasibility of zero-shot generalizability in dialog. Ablation experiments are also presented to demonstrate the efficacy of SAM.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "a6b431df3b3d40c98d8d623cab559a9cddd41662", "arXivId": "2106.07056", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07056.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Shikib Mehri", "M.
