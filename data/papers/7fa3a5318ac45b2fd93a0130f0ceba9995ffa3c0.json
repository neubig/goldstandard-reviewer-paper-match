{"title": "Mining Cross-Cultural Differences and Similarities in Social Media", "abstract": "Cross-cultural differences and similarities are common in cross-lingual natural language understanding, especially for research in social media. For instance, people of distinct cultures often hold different opinions on a single named entity. Also, understanding slang terms across languages requires knowledge of cross-cultural similarities. In this paper, we study the problem of computing such cross-cultural differences and similarities. We present a lightweight yet effective approach, and evaluate it on two novel tasks: 1) mining cross-cultural differences of named entities and 2) finding similar terms for slang across languages. Experimental results show that our framework substantially outperforms a number of baseline methods on both tasks. The framework could be useful for machine translation applications and research in computational social science.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "7fa3a5318ac45b2fd93a0130f0ceba9995ffa3c0", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Bill Yuchen Lin", "Frank F.
