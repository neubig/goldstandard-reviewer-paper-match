{"title": "Improving Hypernymy Extraction with Distributional Semantic Classes", "abstract": "In this paper, we show for the first time how distributionally-induced semantic classes can be helpful for extraction of hypernyms. We present a method for (1) inducing sense-aware semantic classes using distributional semantics and (2) using these induced semantic classes for filtering noisy hypernymy relations. Denoising of hypernyms is performed by labeling each semantic class with its hypernyms. On one hand, this allows us to filter out wrong extractions using the global structure of the distributionally similar senses. On the other hand, we infer missing hypernyms via label propagation to cluster terms. We conduct a large-scale crowdsourcing study showing that processing of automatically extracted hypernyms using our approach improves the quality of the hypernymy extraction both in terms of precision and recall. Furthermore, we show the utility of our method in the domain taxonomy induction task, achieving the state-of-the-art results on a benchmarking dataset.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "dc2f6f092fa04e334dfe2e8592b6d597e00b97ca", "arXivId": "1711.02918", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02918.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Alexander Panchenko", "Dmitry Ustalov", "Stefano Faralli", "Simone Paolo Ponzetto", "Chris Biemann"]}
