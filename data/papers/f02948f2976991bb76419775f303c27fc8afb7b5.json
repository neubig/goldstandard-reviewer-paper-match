{"title": "Learning Rules that Classify E-Mail", "abstract": "Two methods for learning text classifiers are compared on classification problems that might arise in filtering and filing personM e-mail messages: a \"traxiitionM IR\" method based on TF-IDF weighting, and a new method for learning sets of \"keyword-spotting rules\" based on the RIPPER rule learning algorithm. It is demonstrated that both methods obtain significant generalizations from a small number of examples; that both methods are comparable in generalization performance on problems of this type; and that both methods axe reasonably efficient, even with fairly large training sets. However, the greater comprehensibility of the rules may be advantageous in a system that allows users to extend or otherwise modify a learned classifier.", "year": 1996, "ssId": "f02948f2976991bb76419775f303c27fc8afb7b5", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
