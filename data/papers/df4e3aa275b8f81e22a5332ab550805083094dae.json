{"title": "Findings of the Third Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation", "abstract": "This document describes the findings of the Third Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation, held in concert with the annual conference of the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2019). First, we summarize the research trends of papers presented in the proceedings. Second, we describe the results of the two shared tasks 1) efficient neural machine translation (NMT) where participants were tasked with creating NMT systems that are both accurate and efficient, and 2) document generation and translation (DGT) where participants were tasked with developing systems that generate summaries from structured data, potentially with assistance from text in another language.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "df4e3aa275b8f81e22a5332ab550805083094dae", "arXivId": "1910.13299", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13299.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Hiroaki Hayashi", "Yusuke Oda", "Alexandra Birch", "Ioannis Konstas", "A.
