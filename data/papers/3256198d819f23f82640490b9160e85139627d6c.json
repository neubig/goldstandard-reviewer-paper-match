{"title": "A new stabilized zero \u2014 Crossing representation in the wavelet transform domain and its application to image processing", "abstract": "We present a new stabilized zero-crossing representation with a salient feature that the signal reconstruction problem reduces to a typical minimum-norm optimization problem, the solution of which is formulated as a linear simultaneous equation, and develop an iterative algorithm for signal reconstruction. Moreover, we extend them to the two-dimensional case. Furthermore, we introduce a threshold operation based on edge intensity to reduce the amount of information in the stabilized zero-crossing representation, and experimentally demonstrate that the threshold operation works well.", "year": 1996, "ssId": "3256198d819f23f82640490b9160e85139627d6c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Shinji Watanabe", "T.
