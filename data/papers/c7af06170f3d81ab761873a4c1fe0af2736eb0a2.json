{"title": "A study of social-affective communication: Automatic prediction of emotion triggers and responses in television talk shows", "abstract": "Advancements in spoken language technologies have allowed users to interact with computers in an increasingly natural manner. However, most conversational agents or dialogue systems are yet to consider emotional awareness in interaction. To consider emotion in these situations, social-affective knowledge in conversational agents is essential. In this paper, we present a study of the social-affective process in natural conversation from television talk shows. We analyze occurrences of emotion (emotional responses), and the events that elicit them (emotional triggers). We then utilize our analysis for prediction to model the ability of a dialogue system to decide an action and response in an affective interaction. This knowledge has great potential to incorporate emotion into human-computer interaction. Experiments in two languages, English and Indonesian, show that automatic prediction performance surpasses random guessing accuracy.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "c7af06170f3d81ab761873a4c1fe0af2736eb0a2", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nurul Lubis", "S.
