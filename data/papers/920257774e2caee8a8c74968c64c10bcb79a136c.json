{"title": "A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Vector Fitting Based Approach for Approximation of Propagation Function of Transmission Lines", "abstract": "A hybrid genetic algorithm and vector fitting based approach is proposed for the approximation of the propagation function of transmission lines. In this work, the process of guessing the number of poles and then adjusting corresponding delay times in the conventional method is improved by the genetic algorithm. The proposed approach can result in a better approximation of propagation function, which is proven by a successful implementation to an overhead single core coaxial cable.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "920257774e2caee8a8c74968c64c10bcb79a136c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yue Yu", "Q.Y.
