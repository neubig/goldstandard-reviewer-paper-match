{"title": "Pruning Algorithms for Low-Dimensional Non-metric k-NN Search: A Case Study", "abstract": "We focus on low-dimensional non-metric search, where tree-based approaches permit efficient and accurate retrieval while having short indexing time. These methods rely on space partitioning and require a pruning rule to avoid visiting unpromising parts. We consider two known data-driven approaches to extend these rules to non-metric spaces: TriGen and a piece-wise linear approximation of the pruning rule. We propose and evaluate two adaptations of TriGen to non-symmetric similarities (TriGen does not support non-symmetric distances). We also evaluate a hybrid of TriGen and the piece-wise linear approximation pruning. We find that this hybrid approach is often more effective than either of the pruning rules. We make our software publicly available.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "05b0c768ecd4a82e486923e83250ddd53bacbf67", "arXivId": "1910.03539", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.03539.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Leonid Boytsov", "Eric Nyberg"]}
