{"title": "Towards High-Reliability Speech Translation in the Medical Domain", "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the overall design for a speech translation system that aims to reduce the problems caused by language barriers in medical situations. As first steps to building a system according to this design, we describe a collection of a medical corpus, and some translation experiments performed on this corpus. As a result of the experiments, we find that the best of three modern translation systems is able to translate 33%-81% of the sentences in a way such that the main content is understandable.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "3e33c988969b4c9f1d9af8c1c0f7644a30d0311f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Graham Neubig", "S.
