{"title": "Context-sensitive learning methods for text categorization", "abstract": "Two recently implemented machine-learning algorithms, RIPPER and sleeping-experts for phrases, are evaluated on a number of large text categorization problems. These algorithms both construct classifiers that allow the \u201ccontext\u201d of a word w to affect how (or even whether) the presence or absence of w will contribute to a classification. However, RIPPER and sleeping-experts differ radically in many other respects: differences include different notions as to what constitutes a context, different ways of combining contexts to construct a classifier, different methods to search for a combination of contexts, and different criteria as to what contexts should be included in such a combination. In spite of these differences, both RIPPER and sleeping-experts perform extremely well across a wide variety of categorization problems, generally outperforming previously applied learning methods. We view this result as a confirmation of the usefulness of classifiers that represent contextual information.", "year": 1996, "ssId": "ce2d6de9cec4a6d135c32bb8d2d02bba09928b33", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
