{"title": "An Empirical Study of Voting Rules and Manipulation with Large Datasets", "abstract": "The study of voting systems often takes place in the theoretical domain due to a lack of large samples of sincere, strictly ordered voting data. We derive several million elections (more than all the existing studies combined) from a publicly available data, the Netflix Prize dataset. The Netflix data is derived from millions of Netflix users, who have an incentive to report sincere preferences, unlike random survey takers. We evaluate each of these elections under the Plurality, Borda, k-Approval, and Repeated Alternative Vote (RAV) voting rules. We examine the Condorcet Efficiency of each of the rules and the probability of occurrence of Condorcet\u2019s Paradox. We compare our votes to existing theories of domain restriction (e.g., single-peakedness) and statistical models used to generate election data for testing (e.g., Impartial Culture). Additionally, we examine the relationship between coalition size and vote deficit for manipulations of elections under the Borda rule. We find a high consensus among the different voting rules; almost no instances of Condorcet\u2019s Paradox; almost no support for restricted preference profiles, very little support for many of the statistical models currently used to generate election data for testing, and very small coalitions needed to promote second-place candidates to the winning position in elections.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "805e49c7282b847faee048a63c1f43ceb08f5257", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nicholas Mattei", "James Forshee", "J.
