{"title": "Automating Social Skills Training", "abstract": "Social skills training is a well-established method to decrease human anxiety and discomfort in social interaction, and get appropriate skills. In this paper, we attempt to automate the process of social skills training by developing a dialogue system named \u201dautomated social skills trainer,\u201d which provides the social skills training through human-computer interaction. The system includes a virtual avatar that recognizes user speech and language information and gives feedback to users to improve their social skills. Its design is based on conventional individual social skills training performed by human participants including defining target skills, modeling, role-play, feedback, reinforcement, and homework. Experiments measuring the relationship between social skill and speech and language features shows that these features have a relationship with autistic traits. Additional experiments measuring the effect of performing social skills training with the proposed application show participants significantly improve their skill by using the system for 50 minutes.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "d82592f3a110308366dfc7c42565d437b5bf59af", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Tanaka Hiroki", "Sakti Sakriani", "Graham Neubig", "T.
