{"title": "Multiplayer Performative Prediction: Learning in Decision-Dependent Games", "abstract": "Learning problems commonly exhibit an interesting feedback mechanism wherein the population data reacts to competing decision makers\u2019 actions. This paper formulates a new game theoretic framework for this phenomenon, called multi-player performative prediction . We focus on two distinct solution concepts, namely ( i ) performatively stable equilibria and ( ii ) Nash equilibria of the game. The latter equilibria are arguably more informative, but can be found e\ufb03ciently only when the game is monotone. We show that under mild assumptions, the performatively stable equilibria can be found e\ufb03ciently by a variety of algorithms, including repeated retraining and the repeated (stochastic) gradient method. We then establish transparent su\ufb03cient conditions for strong monotonicity of the game and use them to develop algorithms for \ufb01nding Nash equilibria. We investigate derivative free methods and adaptive gradient algorithms wherein each player alternates between learning a parametric description of their distribution and gradient steps on the empirical risk. Synthetic and semi-synthetic numerical experiments illustrate the results. have and correlations equilibrium the results 10 nominal", "year": 2022, "ssId": "73b22457a2f52a834d73d73a76b4124c1cb326be", "arXivId": "2201.03398", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03398.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Adhyyan Narang", "Evan Faulkner", "D.
