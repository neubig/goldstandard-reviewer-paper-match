{"title": "Encode, Review, and Decode: Reviewer Module for Caption Generation", "abstract": "We propose a novel module, the reviewer module, to improve the encoder-decoder learning framework. The reviewer module is generic, and can be plugged into an existing encoder-decoder model. The reviewer module performs a number of review steps with attention mechanism on the encoder hidden states, and outputs a fact vector after each review step; the fact vectors are used as the input of the attention mechanism in the decoder. We show that the conventional encoder-decoders are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we show that our framework can improve over state-of-the-art encoder-decoder systems on the tasks of image captioning and source code captioning.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "90fbeb4c871d3916c2b428645a1e1482f05826e1", "arXivId": "1605.07912", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07912.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Zhilin Yang", "Ye Yuan", "Yuexin Wu", "R.
