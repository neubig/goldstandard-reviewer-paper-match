{"title": "Distributed Learning with Compressed Gradient Differences", "abstract": "Training large machine learning models requires a distributed computing approach, with communication of the model updates being the bottleneck. For this reason, several methods based on the compression (e.g., sparsification and/or quantization) of updates were recently proposed, including QSGD (Alistarh et al., 2017), TernGrad (Wen et al., 2017), SignSGD (Bernstein et al., 2018), and DQGD (Khirirat et al., 2018). However, none of these methods are able to learn the gradients, which renders them incapable of converging to the true optimum in the batch mode, incompatible with non-smooth regularizers, and slows down their convergence. In this work we propose a new distributed learning method --- DIANA --- which resolves these issues via compression of gradient differences. We perform a theoretical analysis in the strongly convex and nonconvex settings and show that our rates are superior to existing rates. Our analysis of block-quantization and differences between $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_\\infty$ quantization closes the gaps in theory and practice. Finally, by applying our analysis technique to TernGrad, we establish the first convergence rate for this method.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "4f78624defde3b60551cfeb37e3943b267ea704a", "arXivId": "1901.09269", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09269.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Konstantin Mishchenko", "Eduard A.
