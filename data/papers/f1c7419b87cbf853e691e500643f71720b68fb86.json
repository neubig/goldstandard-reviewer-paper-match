{"title": "Online Stacked Graphical Learning", "abstract": "Collective classification has been widely studied to predict class labels simultaneously for relational data, such as hyperlinked webpages, social networks, and data in a relational database. The existing collective classification methods are usually expensive due to the iterative inference in graphical models and their learning procedures based on iterative optimization. When the dataset is large, the cost of maintaining large graphs or related instances in memory becomes a problem as well. Stacked graphical learning has been proposed for collective classification with efficient inference. However, the memory and time cost of standard stacked graphical learning is still expensive since it requires cross-validation-like predictions to be constructed during training. In this paper, we proposed a new scheme to integrate recently-developed single-pass online learning with stacked learning, to save training time and to handle large streaming datasets with minimal memory overhead. Experimentally we showed that online stacked graphical learning gives accurate and reliable results on eleven sample problems from three domains, with much less time and memory cost. With competitive accuracy, high efficiency and low memory cost, online stacked graphical learning is very promising in real world large-scale applications. Also, with the online learning scheme, stacked graphical learning is able to be applied to streaming data.", "year": 2007, "ssId": "f1c7419b87cbf853e691e500643f71720b68fb86", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Zhenzhen Kou", "William W.
