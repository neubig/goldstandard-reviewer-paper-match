{"title": "Activity-centred Search in Email", "abstract": "We consider activity-centered tasks in email, including the novel tasks of predicting future involvement of persons from the enterprise in an ongoing activity represented by a folder, and a novel task where we identify email messages that are related to a to-do item. We also evaluate the task of email tagging to folders, where multiple choice is allowed, and an inverse task, of finding messages relevant to a folder associated with an ongoing project. Empirical evaluation using real world email data, applying a graph based link analysis method and a vector-space model, shows potential utility to facilitate activity management in email.", "year": 2008, "ssId": "97ef5081aa4e2984c16ea78b862266e4852c7faf", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Einat Minkov", "Ramnath Balasubramanyan", "William W.
