{"title": "Analyzing the Effect of Entrainment on Dialogue Acts", "abstract": "Entrainment is a factor in dialogue that affects not only human-human but also human-machine interaction. While entrainment on the lexical level is well documented, less is known about how entrainment affects dialogue on a more abstract, structural level. In this paper, we investigate the effect of entrainment on dialogue acts and on lexical choice given dialogue acts, as well as how entrainment changes during a dialogue. We also define a novel measure of entrainment to measure these various types of entrainment. These results may serve as guidelines for dialogue systems that would like to entrain with users in a similar manner.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "68aa7c7b65365c3303d5024b1273408fb435d178", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["M.
