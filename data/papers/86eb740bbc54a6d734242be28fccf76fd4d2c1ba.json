{"title": "Finite-Time Convergence of Gradient-Based Learning in Continuous Games", "abstract": "We derive convergence guarantees for gradient-based learning algorithms in non-cooperative multi-agent settings. Utilizing the singular values of the game Hessian and of its symmetric part, we obtain a finite-time convergence bound to an -differential Nash. We support the analysis with several numerical examples including a continuous game that illustrates the analytical convergence guarantee, a linear-quadratic dynamic game with a known Nash equilibrium, and a multiagent control problem.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "86eb740bbc54a6d734242be28fccf76fd4d2c1ba", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Benjamin J.
