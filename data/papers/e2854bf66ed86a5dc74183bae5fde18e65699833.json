{"title": "Bidirectional LSTM-HMM Hybrid System for Polyphonic Sound Event Detection", "abstract": "In this study, we propose a new method of polyphonic sound event detection based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Hidden Markov Model hybrid system (BLSTM-HMM). We extend the hybrid model of neural network and HMM, which achieved stateof-the-art performance in the field of speech recognition, to the multi-label classification problem. This extension provides an explicit duration model for output labels, unlike the straightforward application of BLSTM-RNN. We compare the performance of our proposed method to conventional methods such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and standard BLSTM-RNN, using the DCASE2016 task 2 dataset. Our proposed method outperformed conventional approaches in both monophonic and polyphonic tasks, and finally achieved an average F1 score of 67.1 % (error rate of 64.5 %) on the event-based evaluation, and an average F1-score of 76.0 % (error rate of 50.0 %) on the segment-based evaluation.
