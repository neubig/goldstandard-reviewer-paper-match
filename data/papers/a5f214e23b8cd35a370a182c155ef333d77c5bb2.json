This is a difficult problem, given that stance is a complex activity that must be expressed along with several other types of meaning (informational, social, etc.) using the same acoustic channels. In this presentation, we begin to identify some acoustic indicators of stance in natural speech using a corpus of collaborative conversational tasks which have been hand-annotated for stance strength (none, weak, moderate, and strong) and polarity (positive, negative, and neutral). A preliminary analysis of 18 dyads completing two tasks suggests that increases in stance strength are correlated with increases in speech rate and pitch and intensity medians and ranges. Initial results for polarity also suggest correlations with speech rate and intensity.
