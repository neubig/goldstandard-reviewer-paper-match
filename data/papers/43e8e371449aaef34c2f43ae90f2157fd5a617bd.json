{"title": "Pricing for Coordination in Dynamic Games", "abstract": "We investigate the use of pricing mechanisms as a means to achieve a socially optimal feedback control strategy among selfish agents. We show that the problem of determining whether the social planner can establish the desired feedback control as a Nash equilibrium among the agents is convex. In addition, we discuss methods for minimizing the difference between the cost incurred under pricing and the socially optimal cost, incorporating a notion of fairness through weighted pricing, and reducing the impact of free-riding. We study the problem of pricing to induce investment in security measures that insure stability of a multinetwork.
