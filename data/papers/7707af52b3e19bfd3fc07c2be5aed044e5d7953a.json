{"title": "Persistent Homology with Improved Locality Information for more Effective Delineation", "abstract": "We present a new, more effective way to use Persistent Homology (PH), a method to compare the topology of two data sets, for training deep networks to delineate road networks in aerial images and neuronal processes in microscopy scans. Its essence is in a novel filtration function, derived from a fusion of two existing techniques: thresholding-based filtration, previously used to train deep networks to segment medical images, and filtration with height functions, used before for comparison of 2D and 3D shapes. We experimentally demonstrate that deep networks trained with our Persistent-Homology-based loss yield reconstructions of road networks and neuronal processes that preserve the connectivity of the originals better than existing topological and non-topological loss functions.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "7707af52b3e19bfd3fc07c2be5aed044e5d7953a", "arXivId": "2110.06295", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06295.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Doruk Oner", "A.
