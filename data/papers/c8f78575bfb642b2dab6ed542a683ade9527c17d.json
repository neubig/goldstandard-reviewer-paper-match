{"title": "An Axiomatic and Empirical Analysis of Mechanisms for Online Organ Matching", "abstract": "Matching donations from deceased patients to patients on the waiting list account for over 85% of all kidney transplants performed in Australia. As algorithms are given responsibility to make decisions that impact our lives, there is increasing awareness of the need to understand the properties, e.g., efficiency, fairness, stability, and strategyproofness, of these algorithmic decisions. Deceased organ matching is an unusual two-sided market as both sides are dynamic and at each time step. In addition, both sides of the market share identical preferences over the other side: each prefers the healthiest organ or patient available. However, these preferences are dynamic as the health and age of the patients change over time. We propose a simple mechanism to perform matching in this dynamic, two-sided market and compare this new mechanism with the more complex algorithm currently under consideration by the Organ and Tissue Authority in Australia. We study axiomatic properties of these online mechanisms including the robustness measures of stability and strategyproofness. We identify a number of different types of fairness, such as to patients, to regions and to blood types and consider how they can be achieved. We also perform experiments using real world data provided by the Organ and Tissue Authority of Australia. Through both the axiomatic and empirical analysis we find that our simple mechanism is more efficient, more stable, and fairer compared to the other mechanism currently under consideration.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "c8f78575bfb642b2dab6ed542a683ade9527c17d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nicholas Mattei", "Abdallah Saffidine", "T.
