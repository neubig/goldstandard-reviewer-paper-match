{"title": "Dr.Quad at MEDIQA 2019: Towards Textual Inference and Question Entailment using contextualized representations", "abstract": "This paper presents the submissions by TeamDr.Quad to the ACL-BioNLP 2019 shared task on Textual Inference and Question Entailment in the Medical Domain. Our system is based on the prior work Liu et al. (2019) which uses a multi-task objective function for textual entailment. In this work, we explore different strategies for generalizing state-of-the-art language understanding models to the specialized medical domain. Our results on the shared task demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge through data augmentation is a powerful strategy for addressing challenges posed specialized domains such as medicine.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "f07a326e21395f025a87b2d77cac7e8ca502f002", "arXivId": "1907.10136", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10136.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Vinayshekhar Bannihatti Kumar", "A.
