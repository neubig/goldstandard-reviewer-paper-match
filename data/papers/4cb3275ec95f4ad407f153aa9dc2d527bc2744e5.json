{"title": "PROSODY-CONTROLLABLE HMM-BASED SPEECH SYNTHESIS USING SPEECH INPUT", "abstract": "This paper proposes an HMM-based speech synthesis system that makes it possible to control the prosody of the synthesized speech through speech input. As creative activities using speech synthesis technologies have been rapidly growing in popularity, there is great demand for interfaces to synthesize speech of a specific target speaker as the users want. The proposed system allows the users to guide prosody of synthetic speech of the target speaker by using their own speech while preserving the original functionality of the HMM-based speech synthesis as a text-to-speech synthesis system. The proposed system consists of 3 main modules: a duration determination module, a F0 modification module, and a speech parameter generation module. The first 2 modules ensure that the duration and F0 of the input speech are reflected in the synthetic speech, and the last module generates synthetic speech parameters according to the determined duration. We examine properties of each module on speech quality and prosodic mimicking ability of synthetic speech, with experimental resulting demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "4cb3275ec95f4ad407f153aa9dc2d527bc2744e5", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Y.
