{"title": "Creating a memory of causal relationships, by Michael Pazzani, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1990", "abstract": "Creating a Memory of Causal Relationships describes the OCCAM program. OCCAM is an incremental learning system that inputs examples of sequences of causally connected events and constructs a causal model of the processes that govern the events. A variety of learning methods are used in OCCAM, ranging from strong, knowledge-intensive methods like explanation-based learning to weak, knowledge-free learning methods like similaritybased learning. OCCAM has two major goals: to model how humans do learn, and to propose an effective method by which computers can learn causal relationships. This review attempts to evaluate the research described in Creating a Memory of Causal Relationships. This evaluation is primarily from the prospective of AI machine learning, although I have also made an attempt to evaluate OCCAM'S contribution as a model of human learning.", "year": 1993, "ssId": "33206a493e3519d27df968e98eb7fe6af14ef985", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
