{"title": "Evaluating the Morphosyntactic Well-formedness of Generated Texts", "abstract": "Text generation systems are ubiquitous in natural language processing applications. However, evaluation of these systems remains a challenge, especially in multilingual settings. In this paper, we propose L\u2019AMBRE \u2013 a metric to evaluate the morphosyntactic well-formedness of text using its dependency parse and morphosyntactic rules of the language. We present a way to automatically extract various rules governing morphosyntax directly from dependency treebanks. To tackle the noisy outputs from text generation systems, we propose a simple methodology to train robust parsers. We show the effectiveness of our metric on the task of machine translation through a diachronic study of systems translating into morphologically-rich languages.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "8b20173b98914f36302389e4c761c334fe867dcd", "arXivId": "2103.16590", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16590.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Adithya Pratapa", "Antonios Anastasopoulos", "Shruti Rijhwani", "Aditi Chaudhary", "David R.
