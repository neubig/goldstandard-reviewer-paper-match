{"title": "Iterative Hierarchical Attention for Answering Complex Questions over Long Documents", "abstract": "We propose a new model, DOCHOPPER, that iteratively attends to different parts of long, heirarchically structured documents to answer complex questions. Similar to multi-hop question-answering (QA) systems, at each step, DOCHOPPER uses a query q to attend to information from a document, combines this \u201cretrieved\u201d information with q to produce the next query. However, in contrast to most previous multi-hop QA systems, DOCHOPPER is able to \u201cretrieve\u201d either short passages or long sections of the document, thus emulating a multi-step process of \u201cnavigating\u201d through a long document to answer a question. To enable this novel behavior, DOCHOPPER does not combine document information with q by concatenating text to the text of q, but by combining a compact neural representation of q with a compact neural representation of a hierarchical part of the document, which can potentially be quite large. We experiment with DOCHOPPER on four different QA tasks that require reading long and complex documents to answer multi-hop questions, and show that DOCHOPPER achieves state-of-the-art results on three of the datasets. Additionally, DOCHOPPER is efficient at inference time, being 3\u201310 times faster than the baselines.1", "year": 2021, "ssId": "ab17c315f7ee4fe69fde2f3d8ae0e30e4e2f3a2b", "arXivId": "2106.00200", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00200.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Haitian Sun", "William W.
