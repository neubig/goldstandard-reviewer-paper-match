{"title": "Multi-Channel End-to-End Neural Diarization with Distributed Microphones", "abstract": "Recent progress on end-to-end neural diarization (EEND) has en-abled overlap-aware speaker diarization with a single neural network. This paper proposes to enhance EEND by using multi-channel signals from distributed microphones. We replace Transformer encoders in EEND with two types of encoders that process a multi-channel input: spatio-temporal and co-attention encoders. Both are independent of the number and geometry of microphones and suit-able for distributed microphone settings. We also propose a model adaptation method using only single-channel recordings. With simulated and real-recorded datasets, we demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed conventional EEND when a multi-channel input was given while maintaining comparable performance with a single-channel input. We also showed that the proposed method performed well even when spatial information is inoperative given multi-channel inputs, such as in hybrid meetings in which the utterances of multiple remote participants are played back from the same loudspeaker.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "04b44c518b145be625ff270af56cfd2e37900137", "arXivId": "2110.04694", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04694.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Shota Horiguchi", "Yuki Takashima", "Paola Garc\u00eda", "Shinji Watanabe", "Y.
