{"title": "XTREME: A Massively Multilingual Multi-task Benchmark for Evaluating Cross-lingual Generalization", "abstract": "Much recent progress in applications of machine learning models to NLP has been driven by benchmarks that evaluate models across a wide variety of tasks. However, these broad-coverage benchmarks have been mostly limited to English, and despite an increasing interest in multilingual models, a benchmark that enables the comprehensive evaluation of such methods on a diverse range of languages and tasks is still missing. To this end, we introduce the Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders XTREME benchmark, a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the cross-lingual generalization capabilities of multilingual representations across 40 languages and 9 tasks. We demonstrate that while models tested on English reach human performance on many tasks, there is still a sizable gap in the performance of cross-lingually transferred models, particularly on syntactic and sentence retrieval tasks. There is also a wide spread of results across languages. We release the benchmark to encourage research on cross-lingual learning methods that transfer linguistic knowledge across a diverse and representative set of languages and tasks.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "ba4a34680e09e77984624c95f5245d91b54373f6", "arXivId": "2003.11080", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11080.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Junjie Hu", "Sebastian Ruder", "Aditya Siddhant", "Graham Neubig", "Orhan Firat", "Melvin Johnson"]}
