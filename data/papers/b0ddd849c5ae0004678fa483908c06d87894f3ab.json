{"title": "Selection of Shared-State Hidden Markov Model Structure Using Bayesian Criterion", "abstract": "A Shared-State Hidden Markov Model (SS-HMM) has been widely used as an acoustic model in speech recognition. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing SS-HMMs within a practical Bayesian framework. Our method derives the Bayesian model selection criterion for the SS-HMM based on the variational Bayesian approach. The appropriate phonetic decision tree structure of the SS-HMM is found by using the Bayesian criterion. Unlike the conventional asymptotic criteria, this criterion is applicable even in the case of an insufficient amount of training data. The experimental results on isolated word recognition demonstrate that the proposed method does not require the tuning parameter that must be tuned according to the amount of training data, and is useful for selecting the appropriate SS-HMM structure for practical use. key words: speech recognition, shared-state HMM, model structure selection, variational Bayes, Bayesian criterion", "year": 2005, "ssId": "b0ddd849c5ae0004678fa483908c06d87894f3ab", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Shinji Watanabe", "Y.
