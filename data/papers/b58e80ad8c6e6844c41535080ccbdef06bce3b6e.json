{"title": "CHALET: Cornell House Agent Learning Environment", "abstract": "We present CHALET, a 3D house simulator with support for navigation and manipulation. CHALET includes 58 rooms and 10 house configuration, and allows to easily create new house and room layouts. CHALET supports a range of common household activities, including moving objects, toggling appliances, and placing objects inside closeable containers. The environment and actions available are designed to create a challenging domain to train and evaluate autonomous agents, including for tasks that combine language, vision, and planning in a dynamic environment.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "b58e80ad8c6e6844c41535080ccbdef06bce3b6e", "arXivId": "1801.07357", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07357.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Claudia Yan", "Dipendra Misra", "Andrew Bennett", "Aaron Walsman", "Yonatan Bisk", "Yoav Artzi"]}
