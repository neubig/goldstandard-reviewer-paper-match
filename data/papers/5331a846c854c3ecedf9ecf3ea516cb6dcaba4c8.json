{"title": "Sanity Simulations for Saliency Methods", "abstract": "Saliency methods are a popular class of feature attribution tools that aim to capture a model\u2019s predictive reasoning by identifying \u201cimportant\u201d pixels in an input image. However, the development and adoption of saliency methods are currently hindered by the lack of access to underlying model reasoning, which prevents accurate method evaluation. In this work, we design a synthetic evaluation framework, SMERF, that allows us to perform ground-truth-based evaluation of saliency methods while controlling the underlying complexity of model reasoning. Experimental evaluations via SMERF reveal significant limitations in existing saliency methods, especially given the relative simplicity of SMERF\u2019s synthetic evaluation tasks. Moreover, the SMERF benchmarking suite represents a useful tool in the development of new saliency methods to potentially overcome these limitations.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "5331a846c854c3ecedf9ecf3ea516cb6dcaba4c8", "arXivId": "2105.06506", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06506.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Joon Sik Kim", "Gregory Plumb", "Ameet S.
