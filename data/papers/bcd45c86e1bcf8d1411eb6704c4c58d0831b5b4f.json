{"title": "Statistical Models for Frequent Terms in Text", "abstract": "In this paper we present statistical models for text which treat words with higher frequencies of occurrence in a sensible manner, and perform better than widely used models based on the multinomial distribution on a wide range of classification tasks, with two or more classes. Our models are based on the Poisson and Negative-Binomial distributions, which keep desirable properties of simplicity and analytic tractability.", "year": 2004, "ssId": "bcd45c86e1bcf8d1411eb6704c4c58d0831b5b4f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
