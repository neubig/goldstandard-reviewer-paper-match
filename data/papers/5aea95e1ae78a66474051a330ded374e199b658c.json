{"title": "Representation Learning on Graphs with Jumping Knowledge Networks", "abstract": "Recent deep learning approaches for representation learning on graphs follow a neighborhood aggregation procedure. We analyze some important properties of these models, and propose a strategy to overcome those. In particular, the range of \"neighboring\" nodes that a node's representation draws from strongly depends on the graph structure, analogous to the spread of a random walk. To adapt to local neighborhood properties and tasks, we explore an architecture -- jumping knowledge (JK) networks -- that flexibly leverages, for each node, different neighborhood ranges to enable better structure-aware representation. In a number of experiments on social, bioinformatics and citation networks, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, combining the JK framework with models like Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks consistently improves those models' performance.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "5aea95e1ae78a66474051a330ded374e199b658c", "arXivId": "1806.03536", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03536.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Keyulu Xu", "Chengtao Li", "Yonglong Tian", "Tomohiro Sonobe", "K.
