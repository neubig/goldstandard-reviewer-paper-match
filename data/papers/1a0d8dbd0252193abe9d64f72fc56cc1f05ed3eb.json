{"title": "CURIE: An Iterative Querying Approach for Reasoning About Situations", "abstract": "Recently, models have been shown to predict the effects of unexpected situations, e.g., would cloudy skies help or hinder plant growth? Given a context, the goal of such situational reasoning is to elicit the consequences of a new situation (st) that arises in that context. We propose a method to iteratively build a graph of relevant consequences explicitly in a structured situational graph (st graph) using natural language queries over a finetuned language model (M). Across multiple domains, CURIE generates st graphs that humans find relevant and meaningful in eliciting the consequences of a new situation. We show that st graphs generated by CURIE improve a situational reasoning end task (WIQA-QA) by 3 points on accuracy by simply augmenting their input with our generated situational graphs, especially for a hard subset that requires background knowledge and multi-hop reasoning.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "1a0d8dbd0252193abe9d64f72fc56cc1f05ed3eb", "arXivId": "2104.00814", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00814.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Dheeraj Rajagopal", "Aman Madaan", "Niket Tandon", "Yiming Yang", "Shrimai Prabhumoye", "Abhilasha Ravichander", "Peter Clark", "E.
