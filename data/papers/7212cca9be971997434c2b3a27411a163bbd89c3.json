{"title": "Better Intermediates Improve CTC Inference", "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for improved CTC inference with searched intermediates and multi-pass conditioning. The paper \ufb01rst formulates self-conditioned CTC as a probabilistic model with an intermediate prediction as a latent representation and provides a tractable conditioning framework. We then propose two new conditioning methods based on the new formulation: (1) Searched intermediate conditioning that re\ufb01nes intermediate predictions with beam-search, (2) Multi-pass conditioning that uses predictions of previous inference for conditioning the next inference. These new approaches enable better conditioning than the original self-conditioned CTC during inference and improve the \ufb01nal performance. Experiments with the LibriSpeech dataset show relative 3%/12% performance improvement at the maximum in test clean/other sets compared to the original self-conditioned CTC.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "7212cca9be971997434c2b3a27411a163bbd89c3", "arXivId": "2204.00176", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00176.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Tatsuya Komatsu", "Yusuke Fujita", "Jaesong Lee", "Lukas Lee", "Shinji Watanabe", "Yusuke Kida"]}
