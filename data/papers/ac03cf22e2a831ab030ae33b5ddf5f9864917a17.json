{"title": "AAAI/ACM SIGAI job fair 2018: a retrospective", "abstract": "The 2018 AAAI/ACM SIGAI Job fair marked the third installment of the popular event for both recruiters and students. As we have seen steady growth in the attendance at AAAI over the last several years we have seen similar growth in the number of companies and students who are actively participating in the job fair. This year, twenty-one companies attended---typically with a team of recruiters and other representatives---and hundreds of students and other job seekers either uploaded their resumes to a public book before the event or came through the event space during the event. Those resumes were then shared with participating companies.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "ac03cf22e2a831ab030ae33b5ddf5f9864917a17", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["John P.
