{"title": "Improving translation of emphasis with pause prediction in speech-to-speech translation systems", "abstract": "Prosodic emphasis is a vital element of speech-based communicating, and machine translation of emphasis has been an active research target. For example, there is some previous work on translation of word-level emphasis through the cross-lingual transfer of F0, power, or duration. However, no previous work has covered a type of information that might have a large potential benefit in emphasizing speech, pauses between words. In this paper, we first investigate the importance of pauses in emphasizing speech by analyzing the number of pauses inserted surrounding emphasized words. Then, we develop a pause prediction model that can be integrated into an existing emphasis translation system. Experiments showed that the proposed emphasis translation system integrating the pause prediction model made it easier for human listeners to identify emphasis in the target language, with an overall gain of 2% in human subjects\u2019 emphasis prediction F -measure.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "9b1057e1f6eb17abf3962d6cd2f49468d27b94c6", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Quoc Truong Do", "S.
