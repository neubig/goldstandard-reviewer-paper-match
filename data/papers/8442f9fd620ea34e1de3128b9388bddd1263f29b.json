{"title": "Proportional-Integral Projected Gradient Method for Conic Optimization", "abstract": "Conic optimization is the minimization of a convex quadratic function subject to conic constraints. We introduce a novel first-order method for conic optimization, named extrapolated proportional-integral projected gradient method (exPIPG), that automatically detects infeasibility. The iterates of exPIPG either asymptotically satisfy a set of primal-dual optimality conditions, or generate a proof of primal or dual infeasibility. We demonstrate the application of exPIPG in optimal control problems. With an efficient C implementation, exPIPG is about ten times as fast as many state-of-the-art optimization solvers, including ECOS, OSQP, SCS, and MOSEK.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "8442f9fd620ea34e1de3128b9388bddd1263f29b", "arXivId": "2108.10260", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10260.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yue Yu", "Purnanand Elango", "U.
