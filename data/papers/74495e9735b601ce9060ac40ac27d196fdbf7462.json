{"title": "A flexible class of regenerating codes for distributed storage", "abstract": "In the distributed storage setting introduced by Dimakis et al., B units of data are stored across n nodes in the network in such a way that the data can be recovered by connecting to any k nodes. Additionally one can repair a failed node by connecting to any d nodes while downloading at most \u03b2 units of data from each node. In this paper, we introduce a flexible framework in which the data can be recovered by connecting to any number of nodes as long as the total amount of data downloaded is at least B. Similarly, regeneration of a failed node is possible if the new node connects to the network using links whose individual capacity is bounded above by \u03b2max and whose sum capacity equals or exceeds a predetermined parameter \u03b3. In this flexible setting, we obtain the cut-set lower bound on the repair bandwidth along with a constructive proof for the existence of codes meeting this bound for all values of the parameters. An explicit code construction is provided which is optimal in certain parameter regimes.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "74495e9735b601ce9060ac40ac27d196fdbf7462", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nihar B.
