{"title": "Traditional IR rivals neural models on the MS~MARCO Document Ranking Leaderboard", "abstract": "This short document describes a traditional IR system that achieved MRR@100 equal to 0.298 on the MS MARCO Document Ranking leaderboard (on 2020-12-06). Although inferior to most BERT-based models, it outperformed several neural runs (as well as all non-neural ones), including two submissions that used a large pretrained Transformer model for re-ranking. We provide software and data to reproduce our results.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "1ca247158522991ad54cccaac6c6938576a8bd26", "arXivId": "2012.08020", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08020.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Leonid Boytsov"]}
