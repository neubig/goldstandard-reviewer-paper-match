{"title": "Influencing the Influencers: Evaluating Person-to-Person Influence on Social Networks Using Granger Causality", "abstract": "We introduce a novel method for analyzing person-to-person content influence on Twitter. Using an Ego-Alter framework and Granger Causality, we examine President Donald Trump (the Ego) and the people he retweets (Alters) as a case study. We find that each Alter has a different scope of influence across multiple topics, different magnitude of influence on a given topic, and the magnitude of a single Alter\u2019s influence can vary across topics. This work is novel in its focus on person-toperson influence and content-based influence. Its impact is two-fold: (1) identifying \u201ccanaries in the coal mine\u201d who could be observed by misinformation researchers or platforms to identify misinformation narratives before super-influencers spread them to large audiences, and (2) enabling digital marketing targeted toward upstream Alters of super-influencers.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "7ddddea393c2cd70fe716e2dfc5d77daf58449c0", "arXivId": "2110.04899", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04899.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Richard Kuzma", "Iain J.
