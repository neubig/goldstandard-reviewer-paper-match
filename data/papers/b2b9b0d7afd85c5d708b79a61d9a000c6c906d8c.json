{"title": "Learning Graph Walk Based Similarity Measures for Parsed Text", "abstract": "We consider a parsed text corpus as an instance of a labelled directed graph, where nodes represent words and weighted directed edges represent the syntactic relations between them. We show that graph walks, combined with existing techniques of supervised learning, can be used to derive a task-specific word similarity measure in this graph. We also propose a new path-constrained graph walk method, in which the graph walk process is guided by high-level knowledge about meaningful edge sequences (paths). Empirical evaluation on the task of named entity coordinate term extraction shows that this framework is preferable to vector-based models for small-sized corpora. It is also shown that the path-constrained graph walk algorithm yields both performance and scalability gains.", "year": 2008, "ssId": "b2b9b0d7afd85c5d708b79a61d9a000c6c906d8c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Einat Minkov", "William W.
