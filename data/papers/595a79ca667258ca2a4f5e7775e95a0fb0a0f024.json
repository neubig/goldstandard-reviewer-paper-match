{"title": "Improved Rates for Derivative Free Gradient Play in Strongly Monotone Games", "abstract": "The in\ufb02uential work of Bravo et al. (2018) shows that derivative free gradient play in strongly monotone games has complexity O ( d 2 /\u03b5 3 ), where \u03b5 is the target accuracy on the expected squared distance to the solution. This paper shows that the e\ufb03ciency estimate is actually O ( d 2 /\u03b5 2 ), which reduces to the known e\ufb03ciency guarantee for the method in unconstrained optimization. The argument we present simply interprets the method as stochastic gradient play on a slightly perturbed strongly monotone game to achieve the improved rate.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "595a79ca667258ca2a4f5e7775e95a0fb0a0f024", "arXivId": "2111.09456", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09456.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["D.
