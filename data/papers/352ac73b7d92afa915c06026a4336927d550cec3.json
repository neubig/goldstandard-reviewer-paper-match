{"title": "Graph Neural Networks with Generated Parameters for Relation Extraction", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network with generated parameters (GP-GNNs). The parameters in the propagation module, i.e. the transition matrices used in message passing procedure, are produced by a generator taking natural language sentences as inputs. We verify GP-GNNs in relation extraction from text, both on bag- and instance-settings. Experimental results on a human-annotated dataset and two distantly supervised datasets show that multi-hop reasoning mechanism yields significant improvements. We also perform a qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our model could discover more accurate relations by multi-hop relational reasoning.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "352ac73b7d92afa915c06026a4336927d550cec3", "arXivId": "1902.00756", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00756.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Hao Zhu", "Yankai Lin", "Zhiyuan Liu", "Jie Fu", "Tat-Seng Chua", "Maosong Sun"]}
