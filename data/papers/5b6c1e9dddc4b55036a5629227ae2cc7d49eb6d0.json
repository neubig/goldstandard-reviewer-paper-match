{"title": "Structured Literature Image Finder", "abstract": "The Structured Literature Image Finder tackles two related problems posed by the vastness of the biomedical literature: how to make it more accessible to scientists in the field and how to take advantage of the primary data often locked inside papers. Towards this goal, the slif project developed an innovative combination of text and image processing methods. Images from papers are classified according to their type (fluorescence microscopy image, gel, . . . ) and their caption is parsed for biologically relevant entities such as protein names. This enables targeted queries for primary data (a feature that a user study revealed to be highly valued by scientists). Finally, using a novel extension to latent topic models, we model papers at multiple levels and provide the ability to find figures similar to a query and refine these findings with interactive relevance feedback. Slif is most advanced in processing fluorescent microscopy images which are further categorised according to the depicted subcellular localization pattern. The results of slif are made available to the community through a user friendly web interface (http://slif.cbi.cmu.edu).", "year": 2009, "ssId": "5b6c1e9dddc4b55036a5629227ae2cc7d49eb6d0", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Amr Ahmed", "Andrew O.
