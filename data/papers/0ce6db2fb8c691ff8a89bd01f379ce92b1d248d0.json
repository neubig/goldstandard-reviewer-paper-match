{"title": "Bayesian Methods for Frequent Terms in Text : Models of Contagion and the \u2206 2 Statistic", "abstract": "Most statistical approaches to modeling text implicitly assume that informative words are rare. This assumption is usually appropriate for topical retrieval and classification tasks; however, in non-topical classification and soft-clustering problems where classes and latent variables relate to sentiment or author, informative words can be frequent. In this paper we present a comprehensive set of statistical learning tools which treat words with higher frequencies of occurrence in a sensible manner. We introduce probabilistic models of contagion for classification and soft-clustering based on the Poisson and Negative-Binomial distributions, which share with the Multinomial the desirable properties of simplicity and analytic tractability. We then introduce the \u2206 statistic to select features and avoid over-fitting.", "year": 2005, "ssId": "0ce6db2fb8c691ff8a89bd01f379ce92b1d248d0", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
