{"title": "Simultaneous Speech Recognition and Speaker Diarization for Monaural Dialogue Recordings with Target-Speaker Acoustic Models", "abstract": "This paper investigates the use of target-speaker automatic speech recognition (TS-ASR) for simultaneous speech recognition and speaker diarization of single-channel dialogue recordings. TS-ASR is a technique to automatically extract and recognize only the speech of a target speaker given a short sample utterance of that speaker. One obvious drawback of TS-ASR is that it cannot be used when the speakers in the recordings are unknown because it requires a sample of the target speakers in advance of decoding. To remove this limitation, we propose an iterative method, in which (i) the estimation of speaker embeddings and (ii) TS-ASR based on the estimated speaker embeddings are alternately executed. We evaluated the proposed method by using very challenging dialogue recordings in which the speaker overlap ratio was over 20%. We confirmed that the proposed method significantly reduced both the word error rate (WER) and diarization error rate (DER). Our proposed method combined with i-vector speaker embeddings ultimately achieved a WER that differed by only 2.1 % from that of TS-ASR given oracle speaker embeddings. Furthermore, our method can solve speaker diarization simultaneously as a by-product and achieved better DER than that of the conventional clustering-based speaker diarization method based on i-vector.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "adc273bd25ab1e2a66543f23c7a801af0dd80e5b", "arXivId": "1909.08103", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08103.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Naoyuki Kanda", "Shota Horiguchi", "Yusuke Fujita", "Yawen Xue", "Kenji Nagamatsu", "Shinji Watanabe"]}
