{"title": "Exploring CNN and DNN Bottleneck Features for Emotional Speech Recognition", "abstract": "Emotion influences the speech and degrades. Therefore emotional speech degrades ASR quality due to the mismatch between input speech and the acoustic model. In this study, we focus on feature transformation methods to solve this mismatch. We propose a tandem approach using DNN bottleneck features and CNN bottleneck features for emotional speech recognition. The bottleneck features are made by a deep neural network hidden layer that has a smaller number of nodes than other layers. We hypothesize that bottleneck sturucture can extract features and bottleneck features represent essential features of phonemes. By using bottleneck features for emotional speech recognition, we confirm that results improve results compared with other feature transformation methods. In addition, we combine the proposed methods and other feature transformation methods to improve emotional speech recognition.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "c37ecbccecab1774b545a5a5804b575718218f7d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kohei Mukaihara", "S.
