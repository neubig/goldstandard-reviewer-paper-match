{"title": "Towards a Speech Translation System Considering Simultaneity", "abstract": "In conventional speech translation systems, it is difficult to understand the content of news and lectures in real time, because of the large delay between the begining of the utterance and the end of synthesis. In this research, we try to improve translation start time and translation processing time of the machine translation module. Concretely, using the phrase table of phrase-base translation, we propose a method of shortening the translation unit and examine the effect on translation speed and accuracy. Through experimental evaluation, we confirmed the fact that translation start time and translation processing time decrease.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "d29f155060f96becef0247ee77dc038f96b2d983", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["\u85e4\u7530 \u670b\u5e0c", "Graham Neubig", "Sakti Sakriani", "\u6238\u7530 \u667a\u57fa", "\u4e2d\u6751 \u54f2\u90ce"]}
