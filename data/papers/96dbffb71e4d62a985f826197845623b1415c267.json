{"title": "Towards a Computational Model of Why Some Students Learn Faster than Others", "abstract": "Learners that have better metacognition acquire knowledge faster than others who do not. If we had better models of such learning, we would be able to build a better metacognitive educational system. In this paper, we propose a computational model that uses a probabilistic context free grammar induction algorithm yielding metacognitive learning by acquiring deep features to assist future learning. We discuss the challenges of integrating this model into a synthetic student, and possible future studies in using this model to better understand human learning. Preliminary results suggest that both stronger prior knowledge and a better learning strategy can speed up the learning process. Some model variations generate human-like error pattern.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "96dbffb71e4d62a985f826197845623b1415c267", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nan Li", "Noboru Matsuda", "William W.
