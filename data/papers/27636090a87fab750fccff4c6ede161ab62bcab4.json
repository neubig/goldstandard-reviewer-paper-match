{"title": "Increasing Network Visibility Using Coded Repetition Beacon Piggybacking", "abstract": "Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) is one of the most challenging research areas in the field of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks. In this research, we propose a new mechanism for increasing network visibility, by taking the information gained from periodic safety messages (beacons), and inserting it into a 'neighbor' table. The table will be propagated to all neighbors giving a wider vision for each vehicle belonging to the network. It will also decrease the risk of collision at road junctions as each vehicle will have prior knowledge oncoming vehicles before reaching the junction.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "27636090a87fab750fccff4c6ede161ab62bcab4", "arXivId": "1301.7170", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.7170.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["G.
