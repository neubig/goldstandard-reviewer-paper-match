{"title": "Automated Fact Checking in the News Room", "abstract": "Fact checking is an essential task in journalism; its importance has been highlighted due to recently increased concerns and efforts in combating misinformation. In this paper, we present an automated fact checking platform which given a claim, it retrieves relevant textual evidence from a document collection, predicts whether each piece of evidence supports or refutes the claim, and returns a final verdict. We describe the architecture of the system and the user interface, focusing on the choices made to improve its user friendliness and transparency. We conduct a user study of the fact-checking platform in a journalistic setting: we integrated it with a collection of news articles and provide an evaluation of the platform using feedback from journalists in their workflow. We found that the predictions of our platform were correct 58% of the time, and 59% of the returned evidence was relevant.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "d5810f15cfdd59da549ffa648c5a05d806d94eb7", "arXivId": "1904.02037", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02037.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Sebasti\u00e3o Miranda", "David Nogueira", "A.
