{"title": "Data Integration for Many Data Sources using Context-Sensitive Similarity Metrics", "abstract": "Good similarity functions are crucial for many important subtasks in data integration, such as \u201csoft joins\u201d and data deduping, and one widely-used similarity function is TFIDF similarity. In this paper we describe a modification of TFIDF similarity that is more appropriate for certain datasets: namely, large data collections formed by merging together many smaller collections, each of which is (nearly) duplicate-free. Our similarity metric, called CX.IDF, shares TFIDF\u2019s most important properties: it can be computed efficiently and stored compactly; it can be\u201clearned\u201dusing few passes over a dataset (in experiments, one or three passes are used), and is wellsuited to parallelization; and finally, like TFIDF, it requires no labeled training data. In experiments, the new similarity function reduces matching errors relative to TFIDF by up to 80%, and reduces k-nearest neighbor classification error by 20% on average.", "year": 2009, "ssId": "956aa64b0d5f5802b98bf551d5bab8993b114fd0", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
