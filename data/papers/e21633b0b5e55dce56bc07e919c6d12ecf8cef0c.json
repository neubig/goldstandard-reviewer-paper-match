{"title": "Pac-Learning Nondeterminate Clauses", "abstract": "Several practical inductive logic programming systems efficiently learn \"determinate\" clauses of constant depth. Recently it has been shown that while nonrecursive constant-depth determinate clauses are pac-learnable, most of the obvious syntactic generalizations of this language are not pac-learnable. In this paper we introduce a new restriction on logic programs called \"locality\", and present two formal results. First, the language of nonrecursive clauses of constant locality is pac-learnable. Second, the language of nonrecursive clauses of constant locality is strictly more expressive than the language of nonrecursive determinate clauses of constant depth. Hence, constant-locality clauses are a pac-learnable generalization of constant-depth determinate clauses.", "year": 1994, "ssId": "e21633b0b5e55dce56bc07e919c6d12ecf8cef0c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
