{"title": "Argumentation Mining on the Web from Information Seeking Perspective", "abstract": "In this paper, we argue that an annotation scheme for argumentation mining is a function of the task requirements and the corpus properties. There is no one-size-fits-all argumentation theory to be applied to realistic data on the Web. In two annotation studies, we experiment with 80 German newspaper editorials from the Web and about one thousand English documents from forums, comments, and blogs. Our example topics are taken from the educational domain. \nTo formalize the problem of annotating arguments, in the first case, we apply a Claim-Premise scheme, and in the second case, we modify Toulmin's scheme. We find that the choice of the argument components to be annotated strongly depends on the register, the length of the document, and inherently on the literary devices and structures used for expressing argumentation. We hope that these findings will facilitate the creation of reliably annotated argumentation corpora for a wide range of tasks and corpus types and will help to bridge the gap between argumentation theories and actual application needs.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "12b12ea73652da56023e0e4776211e4f4301f339", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ivan Habernal", "Judith Eckle-Kohler", "Iryna Gurevych"]}
