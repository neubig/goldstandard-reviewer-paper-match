{"title": "MCoNaLa: A Benchmark for Code Generation from Multiple Natural Languages", "abstract": "While there has been a recent burgeoning of applications at the intersection of natural and programming languages, such as code generation and code summarization, these applications are usually English-centric. This creates a barrier for program developers who are not proficient in English. To mitigate this gap in technology development across languages, we propose a multilingual dataset, MCoNaLa, to benchmark code generation from natural language commands extending beyond English. Modeled off of the methodology from the English Code/Natural Language Challenge (CoNaLa) dataset, we annotated a total of 896 NL-code pairs in three languages: Spanish, Japanese, and Russian. We present a quantitative evaluation of performance on the MCoNaLa dataset by testing with state-of-theart code generation systems. While the difficulties vary across these three languages, all systems lag significantly behind their English counterparts, revealing the challenges in adapting code generation to new languages. 1", "year": 2022, "ssId": "c96363c42bc8c465902c22b8c33c8704233f519e", "arXivId": "2203.08388", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08388.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Zhiruo Wang", "Grace Cuenca", "Shuyan Zhou", "Frank F.
