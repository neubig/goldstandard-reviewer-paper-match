{"title": "Lane pricing via decision-theoretic lane changing model of driver behavior", "abstract": "We propose a new macroscopic model of traffic flow that incorporates multiple lanes, multiple populations of drivers, and local decision theoretic lane changing behavior. We show that the resulting nonlinear system of PDEs is weakly hyperbolic. We then use this model and an adjoint method to design tolling schemes to improve traffic flow on a two lane road example.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "0ca2575a1ef73930dc2abe205b44e079eadc426c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Daniel J.
