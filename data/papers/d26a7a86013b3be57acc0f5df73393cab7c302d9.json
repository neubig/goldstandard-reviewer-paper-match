{"title": "Deterministic particle flows for constraining SDEs", "abstract": "Devising optimal interventions for diffusive systems often requires the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, a nonlinear backward partial differential equation (PDE), that is, in general, nontrivial to solve. Existing control methods either tackle the HJB directly with grid-based PDE solvers, or resort to iterative stochastic path sampling to obtain the necessary controls. Here, we present a framework that interpolates between these two approaches. By reformulating the optimal interventions in terms of logarithmic gradients ( scores ) of two forward probability flows, and by employing deterministic particle methods for solving Fokker-Planck equations, we introduce a novel fully deterministic framework that computes the required optimal interventions in one shot.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "d26a7a86013b3be57acc0f5df73393cab7c302d9", "arXivId": "2110.13020", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13020.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Dimitra Maoutsa", "M.
