{"title": "Learning to Color from Language", "abstract": "Automatic colorization is the process of adding color to greyscale images. We condition this process on language, allowing end users to manipulate a colorized image by feeding in different captions. We present two different architectures for language-conditioned colorization, both of which produce more accurate and plausible colorizations than a language-agnostic version. Furthermore, we demonstrate through crowdsourced experiments that we can dramatically alter colorizations simply by manipulating descriptive color words in captions.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "5ee96dd7e3395d8a53d6d3ceb62593477a4e0fe1", "arXivId": "1804.06026", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06026.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Varun Manjunatha", "Mohit Iyyer", "Jordan L.
