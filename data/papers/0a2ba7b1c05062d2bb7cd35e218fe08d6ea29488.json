{"title": "An Email and Meeting Assistant Using Graph Walks", "abstract": "We describe a framework for representing email as well as meeting information as a joint graph. In the graph, documents and meeting descriptions are connected via other nontextual objects representing the underlying structure-rich data. This framework integrates content, social networks and a timeline in a structural graph. Extended similarity metrics for objects embedded in the graph can be derived using a lazy graph walk paradigm. In this paper we evaluate this general framework for two meeting and email related tasks. A novel task considered is finding email-addresses of relevant attendees for a given meeting. Another task we define and evaluate is finding the full set of email-address aliases for a person, given the corresponding name string. The experimental results show promise of this approach over other possible methods.", "year": 2006, "ssId": "0a2ba7b1c05062d2bb7cd35e218fe08d6ea29488", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Einat Minkov", "William W.
