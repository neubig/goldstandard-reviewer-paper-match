{"title": "Eye Gaze-based Unknown Word Detection in Non-native Language Reading using SVMs and Random Forests", "abstract": "This paper proposes machine-learning based method to detect unknown words during natural reading by using eye-tracking features. A previous approach [1] utilizes gaze duration and word rarity features for detection. However, the performance of the previous approach is not sufficient during natural reading. To improve detection performance, we try to 1) apply support vector machines (SVM) [2] and Random Forests (RF) [3], and 2) use novel eye movement features that were not considered in the previous work. The experimental results demonstrate that SVM and proposed eye movement features are capable of improving detection performance as measured by F-measure.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "b2baf9e053c32abfb3c8658b9bc6d6790ae671cb", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Hiroki Tanaka", "S.
