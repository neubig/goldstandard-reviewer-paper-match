{"title": "GECKA: Game Engine for Commonsense Knowledge Acquisition", "abstract": "Commonsense knowledge representation and reasoning is key for tasks such as natural language understanding. Since common-sense consists of information that humans take for granted, however, gathering it is an extremely difficult task.The game engine for common-sense knowledge acquisition (GECKA) aims to collect common-sense from game designers through the development of serious games. GECKA merges, as never before, the potential of serious games and games with a purpose. This not only provides a platform for the acquisition of re-usable and multi-purpose knowledge, but also enables the development of games that can, apart from providing entertainment value, also teach gamers something meaningful about the world they live in.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "60f3e69e4f18e8e8e7dcc4ba66c1e216b49ad982", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
