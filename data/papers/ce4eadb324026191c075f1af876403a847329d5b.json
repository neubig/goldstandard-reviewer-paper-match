{"title": "Learning Trees an ules with Set-val ed Features", "abstract": "In most learning systems examples are represented as fixed-length \u201cfeature vectors\u201d, the components of which are either real numbers or nominal values. W e propose an extension of the featurevector representation that allows the value of a feature to be a set of strings; for instance, to represent a small white and black dog with the nominal features size and species and the setvalued feature color, one might use a feature vector with size=small, species=canis-f amiliaris and color={ white, black}. Since we make no assumptions about the number of possible set elements, this extension of the traditional feature-vector representation is closely connected to Blum\u2019s \u201cinfinite attribute\u201d rep resentation. We argue that many decision tree and rule learning algorithms can be easily extended to setvalued features. We also show by example that many real-world learning problems can be efficiently and naturally represented with set-valued features; in particular, text categorization problems and problems that arise in propositionalizing first-order representations lend themselves to set-valued features.", "year": 1996, "ssId": "ce4eadb324026191c075f1af876403a847329d5b", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
