{"title": "Privacy Regularization: Joint Privacy-Utility Optimization in LanguageModels", "abstract": "Neural language models are known to have a high capacity for memorization of training samples. This may have serious privacy im- plications when training models on user content such as email correspondence. Differential privacy (DP), a popular choice to train models with privacy guarantees, comes with significant costs in terms of utility degradation and disparate impact on subgroups of users. In this work, we introduce two privacy-preserving regularization methods for training language models that enable joint optimization of utility and privacy through (1) the use of a discriminator and (2) the inclusion of a novel triplet-loss term. We compare our methods with DP through extensive evaluation. We show the advantages of our regularizers with favorable utility-privacy trade-off, faster training with the ability to tap into existing optimization approaches, and ensuring uniform treatment of under-represented subgroups.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "425a4a9c0598e4101ca2f2b930f5c6986ce40a99", "arXivId": "2103.07567", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07567.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["FatemehSadat Mireshghallah", "Huseyin A.
