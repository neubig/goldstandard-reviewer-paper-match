{"title": "A Split-and-Recombine Approach for Follow-up Query Analysis", "abstract": "Context-dependent semantic parsing has proven to be an important yet challenging task. To leverage the advances in context-independent semantic parsing, we propose to perform follow-up query analysis, aiming to restate context-dependent natural language queries with contextual information. To accomplish the task, we propose STAR, a novel approach with a well-designed two-phase process. It is parser-independent and able to handle multifarious follow-up scenarios in different domains. Experiments on the FollowUp dataset show that STAR outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by a large margin of nearly 8%. The superiority on parsing results verifies the feasibility of follow-up query analysis. We also explore the extensibility of STAR on the SQA dataset, which is very promising.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "9abd13caa32b1a90e32462a884a512f8666e80cc", "arXivId": "1909.08905", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08905.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Qian Liu", "B.
