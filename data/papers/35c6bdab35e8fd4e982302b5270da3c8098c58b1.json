{"title": "Modular Networks for Compositional Instruction Following", "abstract": "Standard architectures used in instruction following often struggle on novel compositions of subgoals (e.g. navigating to landmarks or picking up objects) observed during training. We propose a modular architecture for following natural language instructions that describe sequences of diverse subgoals. In our approach, subgoal modules each carry out natural language instructions for a specific subgoal type. A sequence of modules to execute is chosen by learning to segment the instructions and predicting a subgoal type for each segment. When compared to standard, non-modular sequence-to-sequence approaches on ALFRED, a challenging instruction following benchmark, we find that modularization improves generalization to novel subgoal compositions, as well as to environments unseen in training.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "35c6bdab35e8fd4e982302b5270da3c8098c58b1", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Rodolfo Corona", "Daniel Fried", "Coline Devin", "D.
