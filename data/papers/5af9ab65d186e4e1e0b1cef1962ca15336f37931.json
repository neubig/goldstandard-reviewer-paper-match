{"title": "A New Corpus and Imitation Learning Framework for Context-Dependent Semantic Parsing", "abstract": "Semantic parsing is the task of translating natural language utterances into a machine-interpretable meaning representation. Most approaches to this task have been evaluated on a small number of existing corpora which assume that all utterances must be interpreted according to a database and typically ignore context. In this paper we present a new, publicly available corpus for context-dependent semantic parsing. The MRL used for the annotation was designed to support a portable, interactive tourist information system. We develop a semantic parser for this corpus by adapting the imitation learning algorithm DAgger without requiring alignment information during training. DAgger improves upon independently trained classifiers by 9.0 and 4.8 points in F-score on the development and test sets respectively.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "5af9ab65d186e4e1e0b1cef1962ca15336f37931", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andreas Vlachos", "S.
