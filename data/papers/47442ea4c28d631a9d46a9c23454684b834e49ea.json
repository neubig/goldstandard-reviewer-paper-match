{"title": "Unsupervised Event Coreference for Abstract Words", "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach for resolving coreference when the trigger word refers to multiple (sometimes non-contiguous) clauses. Our approach is completely unsupervised, and our experiments show that Neural Network models perform much better (about 20% more accurate) than traditional feature-rich baseline models. We also present a new dataset for Biomedical Language Processing which, with only about 25% of the original corpus vocabulary, still captures the essential distributional semantics of the corpus.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "47442ea4c28d631a9d46a9c23454684b834e49ea", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Dheeraj Rajagopal", "E.
