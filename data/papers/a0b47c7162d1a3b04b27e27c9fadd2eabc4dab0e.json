{"title": "The NAIST machine translation system for IWSLT2012", "abstract": "This paper describes the NAIST statistical machine translation system for the IWSLT2012 Evaluation Campaign. We participated in all TED Talk tasks, for a total of 11 languagepairs. For all tasks, we use the Moses phrase-based decoder and its experiment management system as a common base for building translation systems. The focus of our work is on performing a comprehensive comparison of a multitude of existing techniques for the TED task, exploring issues such as out-of-domain data filtering, minimum Bayes risk decoding, MERT vs. PRO tuning, word alignment combination, and morphology.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "a0b47c7162d1a3b04b27e27c9fadd2eabc4dab0e", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Graham Neubig", "Kevin Duh", "Masaya Ohgushi", "Takatomo Kano", "Tetsuo Kiso", "S.
