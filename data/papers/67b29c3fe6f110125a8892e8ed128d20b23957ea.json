{"title": "Towards Zero-resource Cross-lingual Entity Linking", "abstract": "Cross-lingual entity linking (XEL) grounds named entities in a source language to an English Knowledge Base (KB), such as Wikipedia. XEL is challenging for most languages because of limited availability of requisite resources. However, many works on XEL have been on simulated settings that actually use significant resources (e.g. source language Wikipedia, bilingual entity maps, multilingual embeddings) that are not available in truly low-resource languages. In this work, we first examine the effect of these resource assumptions and quantify how much the availability of these resource affects overall quality of existing XEL systems. We next propose three improvements to both entity candidate generation and disambiguation that make better use of the limited resources we do have in resource-scarce scenarios. With experiments on four extremely low-resource languages, we show that our model results in gains of 6-20% end-to-end linking accuracy.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "67b29c3fe6f110125a8892e8ed128d20b23957ea", "arXivId": "1909.13180", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13180.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Shuyan Zhou", "Shruti Rijhwani", "Graham Neubig"]}
