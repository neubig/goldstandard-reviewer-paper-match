{"title": "GigaSpeech: An Evolving, Multi-domain ASR Corpus with 10, 000 Hours of Transcribed Audio", "abstract": "This paper introduces GigaSpeech, an evolving, multi-domain English speech recognition corpus with 10,000 hours of high quality labeled audio suitable for supervised training, and 40,000 hours of total audio suitable for semi-supervised and unsupervised training. Around 40,000 hours of transcribed audio is first collected from audiobooks, podcasts and YouTube, covering both read and spontaneous speaking styles, and a variety of topics, such as arts, science, sports, etc. A new forced alignment and segmentation pipeline is proposed to create sentence segments suitable for speech recognition training, and to filter out segments with low-quality transcription. For system training, GigaSpeech provides five subsets of different sizes, 10h, 250h, 1000h, 2500h, and 10000h. For our 10,000-hour XL training subset, we cap the word error rate at 4% during the filtering/validation stage, and for all our other smaller training subsets, we cap it at 0%. The DEV and TEST evaluation sets, on the other hand, are re-processed by professional human transcribers to ensure high transcription quality. Baseline systems are provided for popular speech recognition toolkits, namely Athena, ESPnet, Kaldi and Pika.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "6f1ca0249eafa36a5762ac53f6ba2a4ee2133456", "arXivId": "2106.06909", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06909.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Guoguo Chen", "Shuzhou Chai", "Guan-Bo Wang", "Jiayu Du", "Weiqiang Zhang", "Chao Weng", "Dan Su", "Daniel Povey", "J.
