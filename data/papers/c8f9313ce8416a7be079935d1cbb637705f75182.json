{"title": "Improvements to Translation Dictionary in a Method for Transforming Individuality of Spoken Language", "abstract": "In text and speech, there are various features that reflect the individuality of the writer or speaker. Reflecting these features in dialogue systems can be expected to help achieve rapport between the system and the user. We suggested method for transforming individuality by using a translation dictionary and language model. However, in this method, the vocabulary of the translation dictionary was limited because we limited the target vocabulary to words that can be transformed in any context without changing the meaning of the sentence. In this paper, we propose improvements to the translation dictionary. Specifically, we propose a method for automatic construction for a translation dictionary by using a thesaurus and N-gram statistics, and estimation of translation model probabilities using the N-gram similarity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method yields significant improvements in the quality of translation individuality.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "c8f9313ce8416a7be079935d1cbb637705f75182", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Mizukami Masahiro", "Graham Neubig", "Sakti Sakriani", "T.
