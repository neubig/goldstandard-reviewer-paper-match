{"title": "Elements of Optical Solitons : An Overview", "abstract": "(right) K Porsezian is currently working as Professor in the Department of Physics, Pondicherry University (a Central University), Puducherry. His areas of research interest include solitons and modulational instability in nonlinear fiber optics and Bose\u2013Einstein condensation. Existence of solitons in nonlinear optical \u0304bres was \u0304rst predicted by Hasegawa and Tappert in 1973 and its experimental veri \u0304cation came in 1980. Ever since, both experimental and theoretical physicists have shown keen interest in this topic due to its versatile applications. Optical solitons are formed due to the balance between the group velocity dispersion and the self phase modulation in the anomalous dispersion regime, and the governing wave equation is the Nonlinear Schr\u00c4odinger (NLS) equation. Optical solitons can exist in various systems like photonic crystal \u0304bres, bulk materials like photorefractive materials, photopolymers, etc. What follows is an introduction to optical soiltons and their applications.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "0533ccdc4840eed0fe1769b5e78da912631be609", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["K.
