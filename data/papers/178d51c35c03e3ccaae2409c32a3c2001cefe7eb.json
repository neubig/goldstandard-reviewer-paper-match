{"title": "Incremental Adaptation Based on a Macroscopic Time Evolution System", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new incremental model adaptation approach based on posterior distributions of model parameters. We consider a propagation mechanism of the posterior distributions whereby that the process of posterior refinement is modeled analytically. Then, we derive an incremental estimation algorithm based on a time evolution system, which explicitly includes a discrete stochastic process unlike the conventional Bayesian approaches. This algorithm is viewed as a general solution of the Kalman filter algorithm, where posterior distributions make a transition after every input of an utterance set, and where the evolutions of posterior distributions are represented on a macroscopic time scale.", "year": 2007, "ssId": "178d51c35c03e3ccaae2409c32a3c2001cefe7eb", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Shinji Watanabe", "A.
