{"title": "NOCOA: A Computer-Based Training Tool for Social and Communication Skills That Exploits Non-verbal Behaviors", "abstract": "The number of people with social skills and communication difficulties is now greater than ever for a variety of reasons. Our objective is to measure these difficulties, and enable people with these difficulties to improve their social and communication skills for use in the real world. This paper examines the relationship between non-verbal communication skills and the autism spectrum quotient among members of the general population. We also propose a training framework for these skills. Preand postlearning results were examined to find the effects of the training. The results showed an improvement after a 20-minute learning session, indicating that training could help enhance non-verbal communication skills for members of the general population.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "af553d6121d338fc74dbd5faa43d5383a222198d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Hiroki Tanaka", "S.
