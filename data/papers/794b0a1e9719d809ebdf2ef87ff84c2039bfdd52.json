{"title": "Design of WirelessHART Protocol Stack Based on Qp Architecture", "abstract": "WirelessHART protocol is mainly used in the field of industrial process control, and is known for its simplicity, reliability and security. The WirelessHART data service is made up of a series of events. The communication between different state machines is also delivered through events. At the same time, each layer of protocol is composed of several state machines. Therefore, the WirelessHART protocol stack can be designed based on the Qp event-driven architecture. In this paper, WirelessHART software protocol stack is divided into seven active objects, in which each object maintains the corresponding functions. It is implemented active objects through the state machine, which can improve the reuse of behavior and save ROM resources.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "794b0a1e9719d809ebdf2ef87ff84c2039bfdd52", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Houen Li", "Yunxiang Zhang", "Zhuyi Rao", "Wentong Zhang", "Yue Yu", "Shenmin Zhang"]}
