{"title": "Tuning Cognitive Tutors into a Platform for Learning-by-Teaching with SimStudent Technology", "abstract": "To study cognitive and social factors that facilitate the tutor-learning effect, we have developed an on-line game-like environment where students learn algebra equation solving by teaching a computer agent, called SimStudent. SimStudent is a first pedagogical teachable agent that commits to genuine inductive learning and studied in authentic classroom settings. Our Learning by Teaching (LBT) environment is also designed to be highly modular and domain independent. Furthermore, the tutoring interface used in the proposed LTB environment is automatically extracted from a Cognitive Tutor authored with Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools. Thus, it is fairly easy to build a LBT environment for a new subject domain.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "dbdb7f25f1538c2a2885d3992e5320e2ee5c23a1", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Noboru Matsuda", "William W.
