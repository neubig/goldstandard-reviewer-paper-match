{"title": "Combination of Example-based and SMT-based Approaches in a Chat-oriented Dialog System", "abstract": "This paper compares and contrasts example-based and statistical machine translation (SMT) approaches for building a chat-oriented dialog system, and investigates a combined method that addresses the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. In particular, we compare two example-based (EBDM) techniques: syntactic-semantic similarity retrieval and TF-IDF based cosine similarity retrieval, as well as response generation using phrase-based SMT. Experiments utilize both movie and Twitter scripts, and performance was evaluated based on objective metrics (syntactic-semantic similarity and TF-IDF based cosine similarity evaluation metrics) and human subjective evaluation. Experimental results shows that the combined system provide the best performance. It may indicate that by combining both approaches, we could overcome the shortcomings of each approach.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "8f1f43408baf1ccb0ec3e7985592326c83ee276d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Lasguido Nio", "S.
