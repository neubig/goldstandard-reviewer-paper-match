{"title": "Discriminative Beamforming with Phase-Aware Neural Networks for Speech Enhancement and Recognition", "abstract": "Speech-processing systems such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) usually consist of a large number of steps to accomplish their tasks. Due to the long processing pipeline, the processing steps are usually designed to optimize cost functions that are not directly related to the task, leading to suboptimal performance. In this chapter, we introduce a beamforming (BF) network to perform spatial filtering that is optimal for the ASR task. The BF network takes in array signals and predicts the optimal beamforming parameters in the frequency domain, assuming that the array geometry does not change. The network consists of both deterministic processing steps and trainable steps realized by neural networks and trained to minimize the cross-entropy cost function of ASR. In our experiments, the BF network is trained with both artificially generated and real microphone array signals. On the AMI meeting transcription, we found that the trained BF network produces competitive ASR results compared to traditional delay-and-sum beamforming on unseen array signals.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "254d1b8cf247ae8b19e017f7ba758d670207ddda", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Xiong Xiao", "Shinji Watanabe", "Hakan Erdogan", "Michael I.
