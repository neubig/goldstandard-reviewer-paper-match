{"title": "Capsule Networks for Semantic Segmentation", "abstract": "The importance of scene understanding as a core computer vision problem is highlighted by the fact that an increasing number of applications nourish from inferring knowledge from the problem statement of scene parsing and understanding the context and relations between all the objects involved. These problems are majorly being tackled by using deep neural network architectures, usually Convolutional Neural Networks, which are surpassing other approaches by a large margin in terms of accuracy. But there remain quite a few drawbacks and limitations to this approach in terms of efficiency. Therefore, we review a newly introduced concept of encapsulation of auto-encoders, to give a multi-dimensional representation to the given scene, as an efficient alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks. This paper also proposes a novel use case for Capsule Networks to be used in Semantic Segmentation, a possibility which has never been solitarily explored before.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "5ebe542ee1a7eab7aad8e36ed53dbdd7ebd98c8d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["S.
