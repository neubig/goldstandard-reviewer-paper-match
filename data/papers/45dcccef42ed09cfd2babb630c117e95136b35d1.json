{"title": "Show, Don't Tell: Demonstrations Outperform Descriptions for Schema-Guided Task-Oriented Dialogue", "abstract": "Building universal dialogue systems that can seamlessly operate across multiple do-mains/APIs and generalize to new ones with minimal supervision and maintenance is a critical challenge. Recent works have leveraged natural language descriptions for schema elements to enable such systems; however, descriptions can only indirectly convey schema semantics. In this work, we propose Show, Don\u2019t Tell , a prompt format for seq2seq modeling which uses a short labeled example dialogue to show the semantics of schema elements rather than tell the model via descriptions. While requiring similar effort from service developers, we show that using short examples as schema representations with large language models results in stronger performance and better generalization on two popular dialogue state tracking benchmarks: the Schema-Guided Dialogue dataset and the MultiWoZ leave-one-out benchmark.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "45dcccef42ed09cfd2babb630c117e95136b35d1", "arXivId": "2204.04327", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04327.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Raghav Gupta", "Harrison Lee", "Jeffrey Zhao", "Abhinav Rastogi", "Yuanbin Cao", "Yonghui Wu"]}
