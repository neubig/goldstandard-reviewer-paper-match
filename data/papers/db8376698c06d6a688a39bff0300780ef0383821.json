{"title": "Decentralised control of corrugator line", "abstract": "In a decentralized control method for a line manufacturing corrugated cardboard which pastes a liner on the corrugated medium to make a single-faced corrugated board, pastes another liner on this single-faced corrugated board to make double-faced board, and cuts the board into desired lengths, a local control unit is provided for each stage. The various stages are synchronised using pulses which are obtained when said double-faced or double wail corrugated boards are cut into a required length, and which are supplied to the main and each local control unit.", "year": 1990, "ssId": "db8376698c06d6a688a39bff0300780ef0383821", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nokihisa Adachi", "M.
