{"title": "NL2Bash: A Corpus and Semantic Parser for Natural Language Interface to the Linux Operating System", "abstract": "We present new data and semantic parsing methods for the problem of mapping English sentences to Bash commands (NL2Bash). Our long-term goal is to enable any user to perform operations such as file manipulation, search, and application-specific scripting by simply stating their goals in English. We take a first step in this domain, by providing a new dataset of challenging but commonly used Bash commands and expert-written English descriptions, along with baseline methods to establish performance levels on this task.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "429b65937d4922578a81e1f0ef5aeab7361ae36b", "arXivId": "1802.08979", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08979.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Xi Victoria Lin", "Chenglong Wang", "Luke Zettlemoyer", "Michael D.
