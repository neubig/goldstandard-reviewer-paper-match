{"title": "BitMEX Funding Correlation with Bitcoin Exchange Rate", "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between Inverse Perpetual Swap contracts, a Bitcoin derivative akin to futures and the margin funding interest rates levied on BitMEX. This paper proves the Heteroskedastic nature of funding rates and goes onto establish a causal relationship between the funding rates and the Bitcoin inverse Perpetual swap contracts based on Granger causality. The paper further dwells into developing a predictive model for funding rates using best-fitted GARCH models. Implications of the results are presented, and funding rates as a predictive tool for gauging the market trend is discussed.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "40fc6e46f2921be346eacff86ce765ff5b28fbdd", "arXivId": "1912.03270", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.03270.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Sai Nimmagadda", "Pawan Sasanka Ammanamanchi"]}
