{"title": "The Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) Shared Task", "abstract": "We present the results of the first Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) Shared Task. The task challenged participants to classify whether human-written factoid claims could be Supported or Refuted using evidence retrieved from Wikipedia. We received entries from 23 competing teams, 19 of which scored higher than the previously published baseline. The best performing system achieved a FEVER score of 64.21%. In this paper, we present the results of the shared task and a summary of the systems, highlighting commonalities and innovations among participating systems.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "1f0524971c20a06d745ab784689eb8833435fde1", "arXivId": "1811.10971", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10971.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["James Thorne", "Andreas Vlachos", "O.
