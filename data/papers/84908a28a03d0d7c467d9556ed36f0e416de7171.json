{"title": "Hybrid Semantic Analysis", "abstract": "This article is focused on the problem of meaning recognition in written utterances. The goal is to find a computer algorithm capable to construct the meaning description of a given utterance. An original system for meaning recognition is described in this paper. The key idea of the system is the hybrid combination of expert and machine-learning approaches to meaning recognition. The system utilizes a novel algorithm for semantic parsing. The algorithm is based upon extended context-free grammars. The grammars are automatically inferred from the data.", "year": 2009, "ssId": "84908a28a03d0d7c467d9556ed36f0e416de7171", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Miloslav Konop\u00edk", "Ivan Habernal"]}
