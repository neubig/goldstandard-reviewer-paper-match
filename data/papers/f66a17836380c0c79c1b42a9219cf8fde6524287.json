{"title": "Answering Cloze-style Software Questions Using Stack Overflow", "abstract": "Modern Question Answering (QA) systems rely on both knowledge bases (KBs) and unstructured text corpora as sources for their answers. KBs, when available, generally offer more precise answers than unstructured text. However, in specialized domains such as software engineering, QA requires deep domain expertise and KBs are often lacking. In this paper we tackle such specialized QA by using both text and semi-structured knowledge, in the form of a corpus of entity-labeled documents. We propose CASE, a hybrid of an RNN language model and an entity co-occurrence model, where the entity co-occurrence model is learned from the entity-labeled corpus. On QUASAR-S, a dataset derived from Stack Overflow consisting of Cloze (fill-in-the-blank) software questions and a corpus of tagged posts, CASE shows large accuracy gains over strong baselines.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "f66a17836380c0c79c1b42a9219cf8fde6524287", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ezra Winston", "Bhuwan Dhingra", "Kathryn Mazaitis", "Graham Neubig", "William W.
