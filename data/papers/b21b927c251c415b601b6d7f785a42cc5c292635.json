{"title": "Multi-Task Identification of Entities, Relations, and Coreference for Scientific Knowledge Graph Construction", "abstract": "We introduce a multi-task setup of identifying entities, relations, and coreference clusters in scientific articles. We create SciERC, a dataset that includes annotations for all three tasks and develop a unified framework called SciIE with shared span representations. The multi-task setup reduces cascading errors between tasks and leverages cross-sentence relations through coreference links. Experiments show that our multi-task model outperforms previous models in scientific information extraction without using any domain-specific features. We further show that the framework supports construction of a scientific knowledge graph, which we use to analyze information in scientific literature.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "b21b927c251c415b601b6d7f785a42cc5c292635", "arXivId": "1808.09602", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09602.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yi Luan", "Luheng He", "Mari Ostendorf", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"]}
