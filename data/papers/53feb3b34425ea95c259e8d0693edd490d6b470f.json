{"title": "An ERP analysis of mismatch feelings from semantically mistaken words by visual and auditory stimuli in Japanese", "abstract": "Two ERP experiments were conducted to examine the semantic processing of mistaken words in Japanese sentences by measuring ERP. ERP is a kind of brain wave that describes brain activity elicited by light or sound. In the first experiment, participants were visually presented Japanese sentences. Each presented sentence is categorized into three types. The first variety is sentences with no errors. The second variety is the sentence which have a word violating world knowledge. The last variety is the sentences with a semantic violation. In the second experiment, participants were presented auditory Japanese sentence from the same set as visual version of experiment. In each experiment, presented sentences were segmented into chunks. Time 0 is the onset when the target words are presented. We measured ERP after correct words, world knowledge violation words and semantic violation words to examine whether N400 ERP component that reflects mismatch feelings from mistaken words was elicited or not. As a result, N400 ERP component was observed after each category of mistaken words was presented in the visual stimuli experiment. On the other hand, N400 ERP component was shown after semantic violation words were presented, but N400 was not shown after world knowledge violation words being presented in the auditory stimuli version of the experiment.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "53feb3b34425ea95c259e8d0693edd490d6b470f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Odagaki Yu", "Sakti Sakriani", "Graham Neubig", "T.
