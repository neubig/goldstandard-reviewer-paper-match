{"title": "ConditionalQA: A Complex Reading Comprehension Dataset with Conditional Answers", "abstract": "We describe a Question Answering (QA) dataset that contains complex questions with conditional answers, i.e. the answers are only applicable when certain conditions apply. We call this dataset ConditionalQA. In addition to conditional answers, the dataset also features: (1) long context documents with information that is related in logically complex ways; (2) multi-hop questions that require compositional logical reasoning; (3) a combination of extractive questions, yes/no questions, questions with multiple answers, and not-answerable questions; (4) questions asked without knowing the answers. We show that ConditionalQA is challenging for many of the existing QA models, especially in selecting answer conditions. We believe that this dataset will motivate further research in answering complex questions over long documents. Data and leaderboard are publicly available1.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "af38829cdb55ee7b71d49399f71397d975e40a95", "arXivId": "2110.06884", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06884.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Haitian Sun", "William W.
