{"title": "Damaged Type and Areopagitica's Clandestine Printers", "abstract": "Milton Studies, Vol. 62, No. 1, 2020 Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA abstract Milton\u2019s Areopagitica (1644) is one of the most significant texts in the history of the freedom of the press, and yet the pamphlet\u2019s clandestine printers have successfully eluded identification for over 375 years. By examining distinctive and damaged type pieces from 100 pamphlets from the 1640s, this article attributes the printing of Milton\u2019s Areopagitica to the London printers Matthew Simmons and Thomas Paine, with the possible involvement of Gregory Dexter. It further reveals a sophisticated ideological program of clandestine printing executed collaboratively by Paine and Simmons throughout 1644 and 1645 that includes not only Milton\u2019s Areopagitica but also Roger Williams\u2019s The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution, William Walwyn\u2019s The Compassionate Samaritane, Henry Robinson\u2019s Liberty of Conscience, Robinson\u2019s John the Baptist, and Milton\u2019s Of Education, Tetrachordon, and Colasterion.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "6a9795853e5f39325deb0d916fe22d9e5a202a9f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Christopher N.
