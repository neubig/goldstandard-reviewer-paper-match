{"title": "Word Sense Disambiguation for 158 Languages using Word Embeddings Only", "abstract": "Disambiguation of word senses in context is easy for humans, but is a major challenge for automatic approaches. Sophisticated supervised and knowledge-based models were developed to solve this task. However, (i) the inherent Zipfian distribution of supervised training instances for a given word and/or (ii) the quality of linguistic knowledge representations motivate the development of completely unsupervised and knowledge-free approaches to word sense disambiguation (WSD). They are particularly useful for under-resourced languages which do not have any resources for building either supervised and/or knowledge-based models. In this paper, we present a method that takes as input a standard pre-trained word embedding model and induces a fully-fledged word sense inventory, which can be used for disambiguation in context. We use this method to induce a collection of sense inventories for 158 languages on the basis of the original pre-trained fastText word embeddings by Grave et al., (2018), enabling WSD in these languages. Models and system are available online.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "b0d644277933988c00b22d8ae012512fe498ad62", "arXivId": "2003.06651", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06651.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["V.
