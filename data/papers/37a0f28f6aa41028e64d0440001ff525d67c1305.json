{"title": "The Constrained Round Robin Algorithm for Fair and Efficient Allocation", "abstract": "We consider a multi-agent resource allocation setting that models the assignment of papers to reviewers. A recurring issue in allocation problems is the compatibility of welfare/efficiency and fairness. Given an oracle to find a welfare-achieving allocation, we embed such an oracle into a flexible algorithm called the Constrained Round Robin (CRR) algorithm, that achieves the required welfare level. Our algorithm also allows the system designer to lower the welfare requirements in order to achieve a higher degree of fairness. If the welfare requirement is lowered enough, a strengthening of envy-freeness up to one item is guaranteed. Hence, our algorithm can be viewed as a computationally efficient way to interpolate between welfare and approximate envy-freeness in allocation problems.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "37a0f28f6aa41028e64d0440001ff525d67c1305", "arXivId": "1908.00161", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00161.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["H.
