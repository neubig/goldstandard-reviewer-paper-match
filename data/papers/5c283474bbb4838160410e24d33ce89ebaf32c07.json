{"title": "Fully Bayesian inference of multi-mixture Gaussian model and its evaluation using speaker clustering", "abstract": "This study aims to verify effective optimization methods for estimating parametric, fully Bayesian models in speech processing. For that purpose, we investigate the impact of the difference in optimization methods for the multi-scale Gaussian mixture model, which is suitable for speaker clustering, on the clustering accuracy. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based method was compared with the variational Bayesian method in the speaker clustering experiment; with a small amount of data, the MCMC-based method was more effective; with large scale data (more than one million samples), the difference between these methods in terms of the clustering accuracy decreased and the MCMC-based method was computationally efficient.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "5c283474bbb4838160410e24d33ce89ebaf32c07", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Naohiro Tawara", "Tetsuji Ogawa", "Shinji Watanabe", "Tetsunori Kobayashi"]}
