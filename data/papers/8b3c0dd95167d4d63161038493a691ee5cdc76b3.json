{"title": "Monolingual sentence matching for text simplification", "abstract": "This work improves monolingual sentence alignment for text simplification, specifically for text in standard and simple Wikipedia. We introduce a convolutional neural network structure to model similarity between two sentences. Due to the limitation of available parallel corpora, the model is trained in a semi-supervised way, by using the output of a knowledge-based high performance aligning system. We apply the resulting similarity score to rescore the knowledge-based output, and adapt the model by a small hand-aligned dataset. Experiments show that both rescoring and adaptation improve the performance of knowledge-based method.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "8b3c0dd95167d4d63161038493a691ee5cdc76b3", "arXivId": "1809.08703", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08703.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yonghui Huang", "Yunhui Li", "Yi Luan"]}
