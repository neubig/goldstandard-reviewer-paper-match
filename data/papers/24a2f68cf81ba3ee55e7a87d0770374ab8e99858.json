{"title": "The Pac-Learnability of Recursive Logic Programs", "abstract": "We analyze the learnability of function-free recursive logic programs in the models of polynomial predictability and identiication from equivalence queries. Our ultimate goal is delineating the boundaries of eecient learnability for recursive logic programs. In the rst portion of the paper, we describe a restricted class of recursive programs that is learnable from equivalence queries alone. The learning algorithm employs a novel method of generalizing examples called \\forced simulation\". Although the class of learnable programs does include some well-known benchmark problems, it is extremely constrained. In the second portion of this paper, we provide a number of negative results, showing that relaxing any of the constraints in any natural way leads to a computationally diicult learning problem. In particular, we show that generalizing the restricted language leads to learning problems that are either as hard as learning boolean functions in disjunctive normal form, or as hard as inverting certain cryptographic encoding schemes.", "year": 1994, "ssId": "24a2f68cf81ba3ee55e7a87d0770374ab8e99858", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
