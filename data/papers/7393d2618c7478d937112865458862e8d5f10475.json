{"title": "Cross-Domain Reasoning via Template Filling", "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the ability of sequence to sequence models to perform crossdomain reasoning. Towards this, we present a prompt-template-filling approach to enable sequence to sequence models to perform crossdomain reasoning. We also present a casestudy with commonsense and health and wellbeing domains, where we study how prompttemplate-filling enables pretrained sequence to sequence models across domains. Our experiments across several pretrained encoderdecoder models show that cross-domain reasoning is challenging for current models. We also show an in-depth error analysis and avenues for future research for reasoning across domains1.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "7393d2618c7478d937112865458862e8d5f10475", "arXivId": "2111.00539", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00539.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Dheeraj Rajagopal", "Vivek Khetan", "Bogdan Sacaleanu", "A.
