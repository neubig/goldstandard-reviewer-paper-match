{"title": "Deep Active Learning for Named Entity Recognition", "abstract": "Deep neural networks have advanced the state of the art in named entity recognition. However, under typical training procedures, advantages over classical methods emerge only with large datasets. As a result, deep learning is employed only when large public datasets or a large budget for manually labeling data is available. In this work, we show otherwise: by combining deep learning with active learning, we can outperform classical methods even with a significantly smaller amount of training data.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "683e201783bf76ab99791a02e3763fd3ab8dad96", "arXivId": "1707.05928", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05928.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yanyao Shen", "Hyokun Yun", "Zachary Chase Lipton", "Y.
