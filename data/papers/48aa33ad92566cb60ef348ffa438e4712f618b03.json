{"title": "Evaluating interproximal and occlusal lesion severity with a dual SWIR transillumination/reflectance probe.", "abstract": "We have developed a clinical probe capable of acquiring simultaneous, multispectral short wavelength infrared (SWIR) reflectance and occlusal transillumination images of lesions on tooth proximal and occlusal surfaces to reduce the potential of false positives and enhance diagnosis. The dual probe was 3D printed and the imaging system uses an InGaAs camera and broadband light sources at 1310 nm for occlusal transillumination and 1600 nm for cross-polarization reflectance measurements. In this study a mathematical model to estimate the penetration depth of \"hidden\" occlusal lesions from the SWIR images was developed. We compared the model's estimated lesion depth on 18 extracted teeth with lesions against microCT measurements. Although the model estimated depth deviates from that measured in microCT at higher depths, there is a good linear correlation (R2 = 0.93) between the estimated depth from SWIR images and the measured depth using microCT. SWIR occlusal transillumination images at 1300 nm also provide information about interproximal lesion penetration depth which can be directly viewed from the occlusal surface. SWIR occlusal transillumination and reflectance depth measurements on 49 natural interproximal lesions were compared with microCT measurements. There was significant correlation between the depths measured with SWIR occlusal transillumination (R2 = 0.81) and reflectance (R2 = 0.19) compared with the depths measured with microCT.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "48aa33ad92566cb60ef348ffa438e4712f618b03", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yihua Zhu", "Daniel Fried"]}
