{"title": "Application of sensitivity based coherency analysis to large power system optimisation problems", "abstract": "Many power system optimisation problems deal with a large number of control variables and operating constraints. For large power systems, the set of constraints may be large, however, the number of operating constraints, which dictate the control resetting actions may be small. From the efficiency point of view, it is important to detect and include in the solution model only a small number of failed operating constraints i.e. the effective constraints. In this paper, a sensitivity based coherency analysis method for identifying coherent constrained variables to be included in mathematical formulations of large power system optimisation problems is described. An illustrative example of the method's application is presented.", "year": 2000, "ssId": "74dccd379776bbb50b352c19b8caf2a7896d58ee", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andreas Vlachos", "G.
