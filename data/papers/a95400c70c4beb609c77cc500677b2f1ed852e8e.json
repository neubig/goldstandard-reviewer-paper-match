{"title": "Generating Questions and Multiple-Choice Answers using Semantic Analysis of Texts", "abstract": "We present a novel approach to automated question generation that improves upon prior work both from a technology perspective and from an assessment perspective. Our system is aimed at engaging language learners by generating multiple-choice questions which utilize specific inference steps over multiple sentences, namely coreference resolution and paraphrase detection. The system also generates correct answers and semantically-motivated phrase-level distractors as answer choices. Evaluation by human annotators indicates that our approach requires a larger number of inference steps, which necessitate deeper semantic understanding of texts than a traditional single-sentence approach.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "a95400c70c4beb609c77cc500677b2f1ed852e8e", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["J.
