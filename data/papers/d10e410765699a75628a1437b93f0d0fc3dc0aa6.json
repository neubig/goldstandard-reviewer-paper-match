{"title": "Accurate Semi-supervised Classification for Graph Data", "abstract": "Most machine learning algorithms require labeled instances as training data; however, not all instances are equally easy to obtain labels for. For example, the best-known papers and/or websites would be easier for a domain expert to label. We propose a new PageRank-style method for performing semi-supervised learning by propagating labels from labeled seed instances to unlabeled instances in a graph using only the link structure. We show that on four real-world datasets, the proposed method, using only a small number of seed instances, gives highly accurate classification results and both outperforms simple content-only baselines and is competitive with state-of-the-art fully supervised algorithms that uses both the content and the link structure. In addition, the method is efficient for large datasets and works well given high-PageRank seeds.", "year": 2008, "ssId": "d10e410765699a75628a1437b93f0d0fc3dc0aa6", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Frank Lin", "William W.
