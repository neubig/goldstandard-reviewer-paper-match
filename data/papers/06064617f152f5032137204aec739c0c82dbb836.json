{"title": "The second \u2018chime\u2019 speech separation and recognition challenge: Datasets, tasks and baselines", "abstract": "Distant-microphone automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains a challenging goal in everyday environments involving multiple background sources and reverberation. This paper is intended to be a reference on the 2nd `CHiME' Challenge, an initiative designed to analyze and evaluate the performance of ASR systems in a real-world domestic environment. Two separate tracks have been proposed: a small-vocabulary task with small speaker movements and a medium-vocabulary task without speaker movements. We discuss the rationale for the challenge and provide a detailed description of the datasets, tasks and baseline performance results for each track.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "06064617f152f5032137204aec739c0c82dbb836", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
