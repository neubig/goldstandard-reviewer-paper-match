{"title": "Unsupervised Sense-Aware Hypernymy Extraction", "abstract": "In this paper, we show how unsupervised sense representations can be used to improve hypernymy extraction. We present a method for extracting disambiguated hypernymy relationships that propagates hypernyms to sets of synonyms (synsets), constructs embeddings for these sets, and establishes sense-aware relationships between matching synsets. Evaluation on two gold standard datasets for English and Russian shows that the method successfully recognizes hypernymy relationships that cannot be found with standard Hearst patterns and Wiktionary datasets for the respective languages.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "9b9ee9a25fc4d9f8ad22c2923c49b8d5d0b83356", "arXivId": "1809.06223", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06223.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Dmitry Ustalov", "Alexander Panchenko", "Chris Biemann", "Simone Paolo Ponzetto"]}
