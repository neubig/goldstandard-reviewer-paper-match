{"title": "Transfer Learning for Traffic Speed Prediction with Effective Spatiotemporal Features", "abstract": "Traffic speed prediction can benefit a wide range of downstream applications of machine learning for intelligent transportation systems. Most existing approaches leverage historical time-series data, which thus makes them only able to work on the areas where large amount of historical data is available. To predict traffic speed of target areas where little historical traffic data is available, we propose a transfer learning framework that exploits historical data of some source areas and various effective spatiotemporal features. Experimental results show that classic regression models and our proposed novel model can achieve competitive performance comparing to baseline methods which utilize historical data of target areas.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "bf4da952df7a6ef9c0b2be8b4b4b69ad63848b8f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Bill Y.
