{"title": "SIGMORPHON 2021 Shared Task on Morphological Reinflection: Generalization Across Languages", "abstract": "This year\u2019s iteration of the SIGMORPHON Shared Task on morphological reinflection focuses on typological diversity and crosslingual variation of morphosyntactic features. In terms of the task, we enrich UniMorph with new data for 32 languages from 13 language families, with most of them being under-resourced: Kunwinjku, Classical Syriac, Arabic (Modern Standard, Egyptian, Gulf), Hebrew, Amharic, Aymara, Magahi, Braj, Kurdish (Central, Northern, Southern), Polish, Karelian, Livvi, Ludic, Veps, V\u00f5ro, Evenki, Xibe, Tuvan, Sakha, Turkish, Indonesian, Kodi, Seneca, Ash\u00e1ninka, Yanesha, Chukchi, Itelmen, Eibela. We evaluate six \u2217The authors contributed equally systems on the new data and conduct an extensive error analysis of the systems\u2019 predictions. Transformer-based models generally demonstrate superior performance on the majority of languages, achieving >90% accuracy on 65% of them. The languages on which systems yielded low accuracy are mainly underresourced, with a limited amount of data. Most errors made by the systems are due to allomorphy, honorificity, and form variation. In addition, we observe that systems especially struggle to inflect multiword lemmas. The systems also produce misspelled forms or end up in repetitive loops (e.g., RNN-based models). Finally, we report a large drop in systems\u2019 performance on previously unseen lemmas.1 The data, systems, and their predictions are available: https://github.com/sigmorphon/2021Task0", "year": 2021, "ssId": "136235d2a3dc4f1c995eaf977aec9c42114da850", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Tiago Pimentel", "Maria Ryskina", "Sabrina J.
