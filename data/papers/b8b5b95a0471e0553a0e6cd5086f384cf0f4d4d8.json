{"title": "Preserving Word-Level Emphasis in Speech-to-Speech Translation", "abstract": "Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is a technology that translates speech across languages, which can remove barriers in cross-lingual communication. In the conventional S2ST systems, the linguistic meaning of speech was translated, but paralinguistic information conveying other features of the speech such as emotion or emphasis were ignored. In this paper, we propose a method to translate paralinguistic information, specifically focusing on emphasis. The method consists of a series of components that can accurately translate emphasis using all acoustic features of speech. First, linear-regression hidden semi-Markov models (LR-HSMMs) are used to estimate a real-numbered emphasis value for every word in an utterance, resulting in a sequence of values for the utterance. After that the emphasis translation module translates the estimated emphasis sequence into a target language emphasis sequence using a conditional random field model considering the features of emphasis levels, words, and part-of-speech tags. Finally, the speech synthesis module synthesizes emphasized speech with LR-HSMMs, taking into account the translated emphasis sequence and transcription. The results indicate that our translation model can translate emphasis information, correctly emphasizing words in the target language with 91.6% $F$ -measure by objective evaluation. A listening test with human subjects further showed that they could identify the emphasized words with 87.8% $F$ -measure, and that the naturalness of the audio was preserved.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "b8b5b95a0471e0553a0e6cd5086f384cf0f4d4d8", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Quoc Truong Do", "T.
