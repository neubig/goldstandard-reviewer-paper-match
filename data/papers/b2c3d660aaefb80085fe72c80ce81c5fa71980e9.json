{"title": "Syntactic Matching Methods in Pivot Translation", "abstract": "The pivot translation is useful method for translating between languages that contain little or no parallel data by utilizing equivalents in an intermediate language such as English. Commonly, phrase-based or tree-based pivot translation methods merge source pivot and pivot target translation models into a source target model. This tactic is known as triangulation. However, the combination is based on the surface forms of constituent words, and it often produces incorrect source target phrase pairs because of interlingual di erences and semantic ambiguities in the pivot language. The translation accuracy is thus degraded. This paper proposes a triangulation approach that utilizes syntactic subtrees in the pivot language to avoid incorrect phrase combinations by distinguishing pivot language words by their syntactic roles. The results of the experiments conducted on the United Nations Parallel Corpus demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to other pivot translation approaches in all tested combinations of languages.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "b2c3d660aaefb80085fe72c80ce81c5fa71980e9", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Akiva Miura", "Graham Neubig", "Katsuhito Sudoh", "Satoshi Nakamura"]}
