{"title": "ASQA: Factoid Questions Meet Long-Form Answers", "abstract": "An abundance of datasets and availability of reliable evaluation metrics have resulted in strong progress in factoid question answering (QA). This progress, however, does not easily transfer to the task of long-form QA , where the goal is to answer questions that require in-depth explanations. The hurdles include (i) a lack of high-quality data, and (ii) the absence of a well-de\ufb01ned notion of the answer\u2019s quality. In this work, we address these problems by (i) releasing a novel dataset and a task that we call ASQA (Answer Summaries for Questions which are Ambiguous); and (ii) proposing a reliable metric for measuring performance on ASQA. Our task focuses on factoid questions that are ambiguous, that is, have different correct answers depending on interpretation. Answers to ambiguous questions should synthesize factual information from multiple sources into a long-form summary that resolves the ambiguity. In contrast to existing long-form QA tasks (such as ELI5), ASQA admits a clear notion of correctness: a user faced with a good summary should be able to answer different interpretations of the original ambiguous question. We use this notion of correctness to de\ufb01ne an automated metric of performance for ASQA. Our analysis demonstrates an agreement between this metric and human judgments, and reveals a considerable gap between human performance and strong baselines.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "203636315f7c9526189d88c541bedf623d63ea7c", "arXivId": "2204.06092", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06092.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Ivan Stelmakh", "Yi Luan", "Bhuwan Dhingra", "Ming-Wei Chang"]}
