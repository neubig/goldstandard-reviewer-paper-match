{"title": "Developing Non-goal Dialog System Based on Examples of Drama Television", "abstract": "This paper presents a design and experiments of developing a non-goal dialog system by utilizing human-to-human conversation examples from drama television. The aim is to build a conversational agent that can interact with users in as natural a fashion as possible, while reducing the time requirement for database design and collection. A number of the challenging design issues we faced are described, including (1) filtering and constructing a dialog example database from the drama conversations and (2) retrieving a proper system response by finding the best dialog example based on the current user query. Subjective evaluation from a small user study is also discussed.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "2a94fa0de804b5efaae1a66f50c3ea96539c46b8", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Lasguido Nio", "S.
