{"title": "Post-Filters to Modify the Modulation Spectrum for Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis", "abstract": "This paper presents novel approaches based on Modulation Spectrum (MS) for high-quality statistical parametric speech synthesis, including Text-To-Speech (TTS) and Voice Conversion (VC). Although statistical parametric speech synthesis offers various advantages over concatenative speech synthesis, the synthetic speech quality is still not as good as that of concatenative speech synthesis or the quality of natural speech. One of the biggest issues causing the quality degradation is the over-smoothing effect often observed in the generated speech parameter trajectories. Global Variance (GV) is known as a feature well correlated with the over-smoothing effect, and the effectiveness of keeping the GV of the generated speech parameter trajectories similar to those of natural speech has been confirmed. However, the quality gap between natural speech and synthetic speech is still large. In this paper, we propose using the MS of the generated speech parameter trajectories as a new feature to effectively quantify the over-smoothing effect. Moreover, we propose post-filters to modify the MS utterance by utterance or segment by segment to make the MS of synthetic speech close to that of natural speech. The proposed postfilters are applicable to various synthesizers based on statistical parametric speech synthesis. We first perform an evaluation of the proposed method in the framework of Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based TTS, examining its properties from different perspectives. Furthermore, effectiveness of the proposed post-filters are also evaluated in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based VC and Classification And Regression Trees (CART)-based TTS (a.k.a., CLUSTERGEN). The experimental results demonstrate that (1) the proposed utterance-level post-filter achieves quality comparable to the conventional generation algorithm considering the GV, and yields significant improvements by applying to the GV-based generation algorithm in HMM-based TTS. (2) the proposed segment-level post-filter capable of achieving lowdelay synthesis also yields significant improvements in synthetic speech quality, and (3) the proposed post-filters are also effective in not only HMM-based TTS but also GMM-based VC and CLUSTERGEN.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "6c520d983923dbe1e437c01086424fdcdd8f430a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Shinnosuke Takamichi", "T.
