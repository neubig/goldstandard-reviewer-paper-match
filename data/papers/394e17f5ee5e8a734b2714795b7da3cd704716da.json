However, they still lag far behind conventional classrooms in one critical aspect\u2014feedback to and evaluation of the students\u2014due to severe mismatches in the number of students enrolled and the number of experts available. One means of performing evaluation and feedback is peer evaluation wherein the answers submitted by a student are anonymized and provided to a set of other students to evaluate. In current peer evaluation techniques, these peer evaluators assign cardinal scores to the given solutions. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to peer evaluation based on pairwise comparisons. We present evidence that such an ordinal approach can be significantly more robust to the lack of expertise of the evaluators, as compared to the conventional cardinal approaches. This work is a first step in understanding the trade-off between the precision of cardinal scores and the robustness of ordinal evaluations for peer grading.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "394e17f5ee5e8a734b2714795b7da3cd704716da", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nihar B.
