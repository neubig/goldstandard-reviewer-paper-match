{"title": "Detecting Speculative Language Using Syntactic Dependencies and Logistic Regression", "abstract": "In this paper we describe our approach to the CoNLL-2010 shared task on detecting speculative language in biomedical text. We treat the detection of sentences containing uncertain information (Task1) as a token classification task since the existence or absence of cues determines the sentence label. We distinguish words that have speculative and non-speculative meaning by employing syntactic features as a proxy for their semantic content. In order to identify the scope of each cue (Task2), we learn a classifier that predicts whether each token of a sentence belongs to the scope of a given cue. The features in the classifier are based on the syntactic dependency path between the cue and the token. In both tasks, we use a Bayesian logistic regression classifier incorporating a sparsity-enforcing Laplace prior. Overall, the performance achieved is 85.21% F-score and 44.11% F-score in Task1 and Task2, respectively.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "b103bb1dc05a48796a3ff0804c11909bf68db11b", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andreas Vlachos", "M.
