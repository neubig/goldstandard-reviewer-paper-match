{"title": "Code-Switching as a Social Act: The Case of Arabic Wikipedia Talk Pages", "abstract": "Code-switching has been found to have social motivations in addition to syntactic constraints. In this work, we explore the social effect of code-switching in an online community. We present a task from the Arabic Wikipedia to capture language choice, in this case code-switching between Arabic and other languages, as a predictor of social influence in collaborative editing. We find that code-switching is positively associated with Wikipedia editor success, particularly borrowing technical language on pages with topics less directly related to Arabic-speaking regions.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "c81bb5ff79e8c7f65a3e28b7ba52d90deaa32fde", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Michael Miller Yoder", "Shruti Rijhwani", "C.
