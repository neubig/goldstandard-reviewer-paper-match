{"title": "Low-Rank Tensors for Verbs in Compositional Distributional Semantics", "abstract": "Several compositional distributional semantic methods use tensors to model multi-way interactions between vectors. Unfortunately, the size of the tensors can make their use impractical in large-scale implementations. In this paper, we investigate whether we can match the performance of full tensors with low-rank approximations that use a fraction of the original number of parameters. We investigate the effect of low-rank tensors on the transitive verb construction where the verb is a third-order tensor. The results show that, while the low-rank tensors require about two orders of magnitude fewer parameters per verb, they achieve performance comparable to, and occasionally surpassing, the unconstrained-rank tensors on sentence similarity and verb disam-", "year": 2015, "ssId": "7729fbebff327bebb9292dc1c51c51dd55390954", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Daniel Fried", "T.
