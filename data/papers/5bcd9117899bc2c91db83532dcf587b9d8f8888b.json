{"title": "Constitutional Law, Cases and Materials", "abstract": "The Concise Edition of this casebook is a compact, easy-to-wield book that focuses on the text of Supreme Court opinions and other primary documents. Like the unabridged edition, it provides as much of the raw case, constitutional provision, and statutory and historical note material as is practical to allow teachers the freedom to structure the course in their own ways and to encourage students to formulate their own generalizations directly from the materials. At about 1000 pages, it concentrates on the role of the federal judiciary, separation of powers, federalism, all aspects of due process and equal protection, and certain topics within free speech and law and religion.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "5bcd9117899bc2c91db83532dcf587b9d8f8888b", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Jonathan D.
