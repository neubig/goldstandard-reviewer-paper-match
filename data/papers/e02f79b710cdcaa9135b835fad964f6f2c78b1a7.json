{"title": "Canine: Pre-training an Efficient Tokenization-Free Encoder for Language Representation", "abstract": "Abstract Pipelined NLP systems have largely been superseded by end-to-end neural modeling, yet nearly all commonly used models still require an explicit tokenization step. While recent tokenization approaches based on data-derived subword lexicons are less brittle than manually engineered tokenizers, these techniques are not equally suited to all languages, and the use of any fixed vocabulary may limit a model\u2019s ability to adapt. In this paper, we present Canine, a neural encoder that operates directly on character sequences\u2014without explicit tokenization or vocabulary\u2014and a pre-training strategy that operates either directly on characters or optionally uses subwords as a soft inductive bias. To use its finer-grained input effectively and efficiently, Canine combines downsampling, which reduces the input sequence length, with a deep transformer stack, which encodes context. Canine outperforms a comparable mBert model by 5.7 F1 on TyDi QA, a challenging multilingual benchmark, despite having fewer model parameters.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "e02f79b710cdcaa9135b835fad964f6f2c78b1a7", "arXivId": "2103.06874", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06874.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["J.
