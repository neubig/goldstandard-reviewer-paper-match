{"title": "The Trade-offs of Domain Adaptation for Neural Language Models", "abstract": "This work connects language model adaptation with concepts of machine learning theory. We consider a training setup with a large outof-domain set and a small in-domain set. We derive how the benefit of training a model on either set depends on the size of the sets and the distance between their underlying distributions. We analyze how out-of-domain pretraining before in-domain fine-tuning achieves better generalization than either solution independently. Finally, we present how adaptation techniques based on data selection, such as importance sampling, intelligent data selection and influence functions, can be presented in a common framework which highlights their similarity and also their subtle differences.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "4ef77ef9b8ca8c8a96f1e62fa86a988feb582bd1", "arXivId": "2109.10274", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10274.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Dan Iter", "David Grangier"]}
