{"title": "Simple Questions Generate Named Entity Recognition Datasets", "abstract": "Recent named entity recognition (NER) models 001 often rely on human-annotated datasets requir- 002 ing the vast engagement of professional knowl- 003 edge on the target domain and entities. This 004 work introduces an ask-to-generate approach, 005 which automatically generates NER datasets 006 by asking simple natural language questions 007 to an open-domain question answering system 008 (e.g., \u201c Which disease?\u201d ). Without relying on in- 009 domain resources such as in-domain sentences 010 and labels, our models solely trained on the gen- 011 erated datasets largely outperform strong low- 012 resource models on six popular NER bench- 013 marks by 20.8 F1 score. Our models also show 014 competitive performance with rich-resource 015 models that additionally leverage in-domain 016 dictionaries provided by domain experts. In 017 few-shot NER, we outperform the previous best 018 model by 5.2 F1 score on three benchmarks and 019 achieve new state-of-the-art performance. 1 020", "year": 2021, "ssId": "6cf3bdcdee6236f9f04e7773e3601dbbb8fbc61e", "arXivId": "2112.08808", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08808.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Hyunjae Kim", "J.
