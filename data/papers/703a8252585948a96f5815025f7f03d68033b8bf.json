{"title": "Two Approaches to Building Collaborative, Task-Oriented Dialog Agents through Self-Play", "abstract": "Task-oriented dialog systems are often trained on human/human dialogs, such as collected from Wizard-of-Oz interfaces. However, human/human corpora are frequently too small for supervised training to be effective. This paper investigates two approaches to training agent-bots and user-bots through self-play, in which they autonomously explore an API environment, discovering communication strategies that enable them to solve the task. We give empirical results for both reinforcement learning and game-theoretic equilibrium finding.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "703a8252585948a96f5815025f7f03d68033b8bf", "arXivId": "2109.09597", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09597.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Arkady Arkhangorodsky", "Scot Fang", "Victoria F Knight", "Ajay Nagesh", "Maria Ryskina", "Kevin Knight"]}
