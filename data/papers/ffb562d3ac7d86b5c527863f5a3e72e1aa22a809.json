{"title": "Parametric Prediction from Parametric Agents", "abstract": "We consider a problem of prediction based on opinions elicited from heterogeneous rational agents with private information. Making an accurate prediction with a minimal cost requires a joint design of the incentive mechanism and the prediction algorithm. To elicit heterogeneous agents\u2019 private information and incentivize agents with different capabilities to act in the principal\u2019s best interest, we design an optimal joint incentive mechanism and prediction algorithm called COPE (COst and Prediction Elicitation), the analysis of which offers several valuable engineering insights. First, when the costs incurred by the agents are linear in the exerted effort, COPE corresponds to a \u201ccrowd-contending\u201d mechanism, where the principal only employs the agent with the highest capability. Second, when the costs are quadratic, COPE corresponds to a \u201ccrowdsourcing\u201d mechanism that employs multiple agents with different capabilities at the same time. Numerical simulations show that COPE improves the principal\u2019s profit (...", "year": 2018, "ssId": "ffb562d3ac7d86b5c527863f5a3e72e1aa22a809", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yuan Luo", "Nihar B.
