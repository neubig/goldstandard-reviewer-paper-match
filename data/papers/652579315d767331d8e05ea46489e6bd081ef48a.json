{"title": "A Case for Ordinal Peer-evaluation in MOOCs", "abstract": "MOOCs have been highly successful due to the ease of disseminating information: anyone with an Internet connection can watch videos of the lectures and download study material. However, they still lag far behind conventional classrooms in one critical aspect\u2014feedback to and evaluation of the students\u2014due to severe mismatches in the number of students enrolled and the number of experts available. One means of performing evaluation and feedback is peer evaluation wherein the answers submitted by a student are anonymized and provided to a set of other students to evaluate. As per current peer evaluation techniques, these peer evaluators assign cardinal scores to the given solutions. In this paper, we posit an alternative approach to peer evaluation based on pairwise comparisons. We argue that such an ordinal approach is significantly more robust to the lack of expertise of the evaluators, as compared to the conventional cardinal approaches.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "652579315d767331d8e05ea46489e6bd081ef48a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nihar B.
