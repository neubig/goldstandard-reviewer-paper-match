{"title": "Weighted Global Normalization for Multiple Choice ReadingComprehension over Long Documents", "abstract": "Motivated by recent evidence pointing out the fragility of high-performing span prediction models, we direct our attention to multiple choice reading comprehension. In particular, this work introduces a novel method for improving answer selection on long documents through weighted global normalization of predictions over portions of the documents. We show that applying our method to a span prediction model adapted for answer selection helps model performance on long summaries from NarrativeQA, a challenging reading comprehension dataset with an answer selection task, and we strongly improve on the task baseline performance by +36.2 Mean Reciprocal Rank.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "2fbb75d7947808698f1554e4d400ec5ecb5ef998", "arXivId": "1812.02253", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02253.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Aditi Chaudhary", "Bhargavi Paranjape", "M.
