{"title": "Assessment of macroscopic models of Traffic Flow", "abstract": "Twist-in mounting structure centered on a component surface mounts a component to a single panel aperture. Each of a pair of capture tabs has a free end away from the structure's center; an interference surface slopes from the tab free end downwardly toward a raised capture plateau and inwardly toward the center. Each of a pair of spring locking arms lies between two capture tabs, providing a free bearing end adjacent the center, and is pivotable at an end spaced away from the center responsive to force on the bearing end, between unstressed, depressed, and locking positions. In assembly, the tabs pass through the aperture, while the arms are depressed by the panel; with panel against plateaus, the component is twisted to cause aperture edges and tabs to interfere; thereafter the locking arm free ends spring through the aperture into locking position. Once assembled, tabs and plateaus cooperate with the panel positively to position the component against axial displacement, and the locking arms cooperate with the panel positively to position the component against rotational displacement.", "year": 2009, "ssId": "aaf7e94e1a2f8891e5c5f4d11d4f135a1687bb0a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["L.
