{"title": "Minimum Error Classification with geometric margin control", "abstract": "Minimum Classification Error (MCE) training, which can be used to achieve minimum error classification of various types of patterns, has attracted a great deal of attention. However, to increase classification robustness, a conventional MCE framework has no practical optimization procedures like geometric margin maximization in Support Vector Machine (SVM). To realize high robustness in a wide range of classification tasks, we derive the geometric margin for a general class of discriminant functions and develop a new MCE training method that increases the geometric margin value. We also experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method using prototype-based classifiers.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "a604ad4654f31d325b888806e276123a704cb5c8", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Hideyuki Watanabe", "S.
