{"title": "High-dimensional coded matrix multiplication", "abstract": "Coded computation is a framework for providing redundancy in distributed computing systems to make them robust to slower nodes, or stragglers. In [1], the authors propose a coded computation scheme based on maximum distance separable (MDS) codes for computing the product ATB, and this scheme is suitable for the case where one of the matrices is small enough to fit into a single compute node. In this work, we study coded computation involving large matrix multiplication where both matrices are large, and propose a new coded computation scheme, which we call product-coded matrix multiplication. Our analysis reveals interesting insights into which schemes perform best in which regimes. When the number of backup nodes scales sub-linearly in the size of the product, the product-coded scheme achieves the best run-time performance. On the other hand, when the number of backup nodes scales linearly in the size of the product, the MDS-coded scheme achieves the fundamental limit on the run-time performance. Further, we propose a novel application of low-density-parity-check (LDPC) codes to achieve linear-time decoding complexity, thus allowing our proposed solutions to scale gracefully.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "322ef476e90a487c8f9797bece7799b69af9e5c1", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kangwook Lee", "Changho Suh", "K.
