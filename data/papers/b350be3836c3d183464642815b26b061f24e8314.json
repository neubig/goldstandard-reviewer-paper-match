{"title": "Learning Mathematical Properties of Integers", "abstract": "Embedding words in high-dimensional vector spaces has proven valuable in many natural language applications. In this work, we investigate whether similarly-trained embeddings of integers can capture concepts that are useful for mathematical applications. We probe the integer embeddings for mathematical knowledge, apply them to a set of numerical reasoning tasks, and show that by learning the representations from mathematical sequence data, we can substantially improve over number embeddings learned from English text corpora.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "b350be3836c3d183464642815b26b061f24e8314", "arXivId": "2109.07230", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07230.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Maria Ryskina", "Kevin Knight"]}
