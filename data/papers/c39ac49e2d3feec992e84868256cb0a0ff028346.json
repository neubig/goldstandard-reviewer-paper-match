{"title": "Recent theoretical advances in decentralized distributed convex optimization.", "abstract": "In the last few years, the theory of decentralized distributed convex optimization has made significant progress. The lower bounds on communications rounds and oracle calls have appeared, as well as methods that reach both of these bounds. In this paper, we focus on how these results can be explained based on optimal algorithms for the non-distributed setup. In particular, we provide our recent results that have not been published yet, and that could be found in details only in arXiv preprints.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "c39ac49e2d3feec992e84868256cb0a0ff028346", "arXivId": "2011.13259", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13259.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Eduard A.
