{"title": "Collective Entity Linking in Tweets Over Space and Time", "abstract": "We propose collective entity linking over tweets that are close in space and time. This exploits the fact that events or geographical points of interest often result in related entities being mentioned in spatio-temporal proximity. Our approach directly applies to geocoded tweets. Where geocoded tweets are overly sparse among all tweets, we use a relaxed version of spatial proximity which utilizes both geocoded and non-geocoded tweets linked by common mentions.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "470fd4faf9b8499e8bf21c5d143145305d07fe83", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Wen-Haw Chong", "Ee-Peng Lim", "William W.
