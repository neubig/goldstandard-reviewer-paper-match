{"title": "Overview of BioCreative II gene mention recognition", "abstract": "Nineteen teams presented results for the Gene Mention Task at the BioCreative II Workshop. In this task participants designed systems to identify substrings in sentences corresponding to gene name mentions. A variety of different methods were used and the results varied with a highest achieved F1 score of 0.8721. Here we present brief descriptions of all the methods used and a statistical analysis of the results. We also demonstrate that, by combining the results from all submissions, an F score of 0.9066 is feasible, and furthermore that the best result makes use of the lowest scoring submissions.", "year": 2008, "ssId": "f5a0c6593ba95d23c025608ce9280848da8b929f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Larry L.
