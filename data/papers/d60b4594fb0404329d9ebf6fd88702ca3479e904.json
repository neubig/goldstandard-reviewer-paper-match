{"title": "Alignment-HMM-based Extraction of Abbreviations from Biomedical Text", "abstract": "We present an algorithm for extracting abbreviation definitions from biomedical text. Our approach is based on an alignment HMM, matching abbreviations and their definitions. We report 98% precision and 93% recall on a standard data set, and 95% precision and 91% recall on an additional test set. Our results show an improvement over previously reported methods and our model has several advantages. Our model: (1) is simpler and faster than a comparable alignment-based abbreviation extractor; (2) is naturally generalizable to specific types of abbreviations, e.g., abbreviations of chemical formulas; (3) is trained on a set of unlabeled examples; and (4) associates a probability with each predicted definition. Using the abbreviation alignment model we were able to extract over 1.4 million abbreviations from a corpus of 200K full-text PubMed papers, including 455,844 unique definitions.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "d60b4594fb0404329d9ebf6fd88702ca3479e904", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Dana Movshovitz-Attias", "William W.
