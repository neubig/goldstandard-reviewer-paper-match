{"title": "End-to-End Multi-speaker ASR with Independent Vector Analysis", "abstract": "We develop an end-to-end system for multi-channel, multi-speaker automatic speech recognition. We propose a frontend for joint source separation and dereverberation based on the independent vector analysis (IVA) paradigm. It uses the fast and stable iterative source steering algorithm together with a neural source model. The parameters from the ASR module and the neural source model are optimized jointly from the ASR loss itself. We demonstrate competitive performance with previous systems using neural beamforming frontends. First, we explore the trade-offs when using various number of channels for training and testing. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed IVA frontend performs well on noisy data, even when trained on clean mixtures only. Furthermore, it extends without retraining to the separation of more speakers, which is demonstrated on mixtures of three and four speakers.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "ab48fb72541653f40523caa9fcaac9cb84bf3373", "arXivId": "2204.00218", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00218.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Robin Scheibler", "Wangyou Zhang", "Xuankai Chang", "Shinji Watanabe", "Y.
