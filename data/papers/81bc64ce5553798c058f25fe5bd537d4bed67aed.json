We show QD luminescence with narrow PL lines, tuning of the emission energies varying by more than 180 meV and ground state to first excited state separations as large as 80 meV.", "year": 2003, "ssId": "81bc64ce5553798c058f25fe5bd537d4bed67aed", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
