{"title": "Automated Social Skills Trainer", "abstract": "Social skills training is a well-established method to decrease human anxiety and discomfort in social interaction, and acquire social skills. In this paper, we attempt to automate the process of social skills training by developing a dialogue system named \"automated social skills trainer,\" which provides social skills training through human-computer interaction. The system includes a virtual avatar that recognizes user speech and language information and gives feedback to users to improve their social skills. Its design is based on conventional social skills training performed by human participants, including defining target skills, modeling, role-play, feedback, reinforcement, and homework. An experimental evaluation measuring the relationship between social skill and speech and language features shows that these features have a relationship with autistic traits. Additional experiments measuring the effect of performing social skills training with the proposed application show that most participants improve their skill by using the system for 50 minutes.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "5801974fcebc11b4a8085fb02e77f792454caf7c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Hiroki Tanaka", "S.
