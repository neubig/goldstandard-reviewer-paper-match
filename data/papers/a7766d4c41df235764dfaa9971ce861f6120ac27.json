{"title": "Low-latency meeting recognition and understanding using distant microphones", "abstract": "In this demonstration, we present our real-time meeting analyzer for group meetings. By using the audio and visual information captured by a microphone array and an omni-directional camera at the center of a table, our system automatically recognizes \u201cwho speaks what to whom and when\u201d in an online manner. We will show some demo videos and our meeting browser to present how our system works in a meeting situation. The technical details will also be discussed at the demo session.", "year": 2011, "ssId": "a7766d4c41df235764dfaa9971ce861f6120ac27", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["S.
