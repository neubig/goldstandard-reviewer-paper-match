{"title": "An Evaluation through Simulation for Direct F0 Control of an Electrolarynx based on Statistical Excitation Feature Prediction", "abstract": "An electrolarynx is a device that artificially generates excitation sounds to enable laryngectomees to produce electrolaryngeal (EL) speech. Although proficient laryngectomees can produce quite intelligible EL speech, it sounds very unnatural due to the mechanical excitation produced by the device. To address this issue, we have proposed several EL speech enhancement methods using statistical excitation prediction, which was essential to significantly improve naturalness by predicting excitation parameters of normal speech. In these methods, the original EL speech is recorded with a microphone and the enhanced EL speech is presented from a loudspeaker in real time. This framework is effective for telecommunication but it is not suitable to face-to-face conversation because both the original EL speech and the enhanced EL speech are presented to listeners. In this paper, we propose direct F0 control of the electrolarynx based on the statistical excitation prediction also effective for face-to-face conversation. A simulation experiment is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental result shows that our proposed system enables laryngectomees to produce more natural EL speech.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "89c148d3d4edcb7b13c35da36b97ffb881c38058", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Tanaka Kou", "T.
