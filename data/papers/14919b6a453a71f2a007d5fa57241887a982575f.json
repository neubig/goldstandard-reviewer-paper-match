{"title": "Corrigendum for \"learnability of description logics\"", "abstract": "The proof of the representation-independent hardness of learning CORECLASSIC in Theorem 3 of [1] is in error. In particular, although the constructed functions ~ and g satisfy the \" if \" direction of w E L(A) iff g(A) ~ f(w) they do not satisfy the \" only if \" direction. Lenny Pitt for pointing out the mistake. We thank Although CORECLASSIC is not pat-learnable under the usual complexity assumptions (as correctly shown in Theorem 4 of [1] and expanded upon further by Frazier and Pitt [2]), the question of the representation-independent learnability y of CORE CLASSIC remains an open problem.", "year": 1995, "ssId": "14919b6a453a71f2a007d5fa57241887a982575f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
