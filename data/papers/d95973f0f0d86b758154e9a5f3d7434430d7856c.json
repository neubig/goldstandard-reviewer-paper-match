{"title": "Accelerated Gradient-Free Optimization Methods with a Non-Euclidean Proximal Operator", "abstract": "We propose an accelerated gradient-free method with a non-Euclidean proximal operator associated with the p-norm (1 \u2a7d p \u2a7d 2). We obtain estimates for the rate of convergence of the method under low noise arising in the calculation of the function value. We present the results of computational experiments.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "d95973f0f0d86b758154e9a5f3d7434430d7856c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
