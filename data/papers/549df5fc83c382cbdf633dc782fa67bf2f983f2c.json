We show that SGDRM converges to the globally optimal point for deep neural networks with linear activations while being differentially private. We also train nonlinear neural networks with private mixtures as the training data, proving the practicality of SGDRM.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "549df5fc83c382cbdf633dc782fa67bf2f983f2c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kangwook Lee", "Kyungmin Lee", "Hoon Kim", "Changho Suh", "K.
