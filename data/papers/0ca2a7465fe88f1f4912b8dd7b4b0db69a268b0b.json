{"title": "Neural Lattice Language Models", "abstract": "In this work, we propose a new language modeling paradigm that has the ability to perform both prediction and moderation of information flow at multiple granularities: neural lattice language models. These models construct a lattice of possible paths through a sentence and marginalize across this lattice to calculate sequence probabilities or optimize parameters. This approach allows us to seamlessly incorporate linguistic intuitions \u2014 including polysemy and the existence of multiword lexical items \u2014 into our language model. Experiments on multiple language modeling tasks show that English neural lattice language models that utilize polysemous embeddings are able to improve perplexity by 9.95% relative to a word-level baseline, and that a Chinese model that handles multi-character tokens is able to improve perplexity by 20.94% relative to a character-level baseline.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "0ca2a7465fe88f1f4912b8dd7b4b0db69a268b0b", "arXivId": "1803.05071", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05071.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["J.
