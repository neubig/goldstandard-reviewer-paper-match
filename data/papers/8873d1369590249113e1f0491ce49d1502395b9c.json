{"title": "Video-Text Compliance: Activity Verification Based on Natural Language Instructions", "abstract": "We define a new multi-modal compliance problem, which is to determine if the human activity in a given video is in compliance with an associated text instruction. Solutions to the compliance problem could enable automatic compliance checking and efficient feedback in many real-world settings. To this end, we introduce the Video-Text Compliance (VTC) dataset, which contains videos of atomic activities, along with text instructions and compliance labels. The VTC dataset is constructed by an auto-augmentation technique, preserves privacy, and contains over 1.2 million frames. Finally, we present ComplianceNet, a novel end-to-end trainable compliance network that improves the baseline accuracy by 27.5% on average when trained on the VTC dataset. We plan to release the VTC dataset to the community for future research.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "8873d1369590249113e1f0491ce49d1502395b9c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Mayoore S.
