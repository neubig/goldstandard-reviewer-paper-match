{"title": "Rule-Based Normalization of Historical Texts", "abstract": "This paper deals with normalization of language data from Early New High German. We describe an unsupervised, rulebased approach which maps historical wordforms to modern wordforms. Rules are specified in the form of context-aware rewrite rules that apply to sequences of characters. They are derived from two aligned versions of the Luther bible and weighted according to their frequency. The evaluation shows that our approach (83%\u201091% exact matches) clearly outperforms the baseline (65%).", "year": 2011, "ssId": "4c66979a31fa4be5b5814fdb5cb8411572d61da8", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Marcel Bollmann", "Florian Petran", "Stefanie Dipper"]}
