{"title": "CSI: Novelty Detection via Contrastive Learning on Distributionally Shifted Instances", "abstract": "Novelty detection, i.e., identifying whether a given sample is drawn from outside the training distribution, is essential for reliable machine learning. To this end, there have been many attempts at learning a representation well-suited for novelty detection and designing a score based on such representation. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective method named contrasting shifted instances (CSI), inspired by the recent success on contrastive learning of visual representations. Specifically, in addition to contrasting a given sample with other instances as in conventional contrastive learning methods, our training scheme contrasts the sample with distributionally-shifted augmentations of itself. Based on this, we propose a new detection score that is specific to the proposed training scheme. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method under various novelty detection scenarios, including unlabeled one-class, unlabeled multi-class and labeled multi-class settings, with various image benchmark datasets.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "e1bb329621de73d08c47beae9b5439a1c244eb1a", "arXivId": "2007.08176", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08176.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Jihoon Tack", "Sangwoo Mo", "Jongheon Jeong", "Jinwoo Shin"]}
