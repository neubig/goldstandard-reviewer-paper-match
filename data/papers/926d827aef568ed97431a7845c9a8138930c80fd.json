{"title": "Social and Affective Responses to Political Information", "abstract": "In this paper we present two studies exploring social and affective responses to political information. We hypothesize that people treat messages from in-group sources differently than they do messages from out-group sources. Evidence from two experiments indicates not only a link between affective reactions and social sharing behavior, but also that subjects treat information from in-group sources differently than they do information from outgroup sources.
