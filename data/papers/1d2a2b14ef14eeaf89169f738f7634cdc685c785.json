{"title": "A demonstration of WHIRL (demonstration abstract)", "abstract": "WHIRL [l, 21 is a hybrid system that combines properties of relational databases and statistical IR systems. WHIRL manipulates a relational database in which every cell of every relation contains a \u201cdocument\u201d (rather than an atomic symbol), represented as a TFIDF-weighted term vector [3]. WHIRL\u2019s query language is an extension of SQL which contains a built-in similarity predicate over term vectors. This query language is given a \u201csoft semantics\u201d. Roughly speaking, every tuple that could potentially appear in the answer is given a real-numbered \u201cscore\u201d, indicating the degree to which it satisfies the similarity constraints of the query. The answer to a query is the k tuples with highest score (where k is fixed by the user).
