{"title": "Learning to Walk Structured Text Networks CMU-LTI-08-002", "abstract": "We propose representing a text corpus as a labeled directed graph, where nodes represent words and weighted edges represent the syntactic relations between them, as derived by dependency parsing. Given this graph, we adopt a graph-based similarity measure based on random walks to derive a similarity measure between words, and also use supervised learning to improve the derived similarity measure for a particular task. Empirical evaluation of the approach on the task of coordinate term extraction shows that the suggested framework improves on a state-of-the-art distributional similarity measure.", "year": 2008, "ssId": "af0aa62d243c761b56a83369bc9b1f75805003cf", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Einat Minkov", "William W.
