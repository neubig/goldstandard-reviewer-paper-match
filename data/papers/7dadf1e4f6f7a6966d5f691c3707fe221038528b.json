{"title": "Computing Welfare-Maximizing Fair Allocations of Indivisible Goods", "abstract": "We study the computational complexity of computing allocations that are both fair and maximize the utilitarian social welfare, i.e., the sum of agents\u2019 utilities. We focus on two tractable fairness concepts: envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and proportionality up to one item (PROP1). In particular, we consider the following two computational problems: (1) Among the utilitarianmaximal allocations, decide whether there exists one that is also fair according to either EF1 or PROP1; (2) among the fair allocations, compute one that maximizes the utilitarian welfare. We show that both problems are strongly NP-hard when the number of agents is variable, and remain NP-hard for a fixed number of agents greater than two. For the special case of two agents, we find that problem (1) is polynomial-time solvable, while problem (2) remains NP-hard. Finally, with a fixed number of agents, we design pseudopolynomial-time algorithms for both problems.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "7dadf1e4f6f7a6966d5f691c3707fe221038528b", "arXivId": "2012.03979", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03979.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["H.
