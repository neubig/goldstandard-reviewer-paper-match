{"title": "Soft Gazetteers for Low-Resource Named Entity Recognition", "abstract": "Traditional named entity recognition models use gazetteers (lists of entities) as features to improve performance. Although modern neural network models do not require such hand-crafted features for strong performance, recent work has demonstrated their utility for named entity recognition on English data. However, designing such features for low-resource languages is challenging, because exhaustive entity gazetteers do not exist in these languages. To address this problem, we propose a method of \u201csoft gazetteers\u201d that incorporates ubiquitously available information from English knowledge bases, such as Wikipedia, into neural named entity recognition models through cross-lingual entity linking. Our experiments on four low-resource languages show an average improvement of 4 points in F1 score.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "98caf4eb79208cf4bbfe20bde37bc1b6ded6d6de", "arXivId": "2005.01866", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01866.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Shruti Rijhwani", "Shuyan Zhou", "Graham Neubig", "J.
