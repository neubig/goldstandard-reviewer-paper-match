{"title": "A Hierarchical Graphical Model for Record Linkage", "abstract": "The task of matching co-referent records is known among other names as record linkage. For large record-linkage problems, often there is little or no labeled data available, but unlabeled data shows a reasonably clear structure. For such problems, unsupervised or semi-supervised methods are preferable to supervised methods. In this paper, we describe a hierarchical graphical model framework for the record-linkage problem in an unsupervised setting. In addition to proposing new methods, we also cast existing unsupervised probabilistic record-linkage methods in this framework. Some of the techniques we propose to minimize overfitting in the above model are of interest in the general graphical model setting. We describe a method for incorporating monotonicity constraints in a graphical model. We also outline a bootstrapping approach of using \"single-field\" classifiers to noisily label latent variables in a hierarchical model. Experimental results show that our proposed unsupervised methods perform quite competitively even with fully supervised record-linkage methods.", "year": 2004, "ssId": "ab57c70c14b82d07c40c75fecaac98b0e2dc0510", "arXivId": "1207.4180", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4180.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Pradeep Ravikumar", "William W.
