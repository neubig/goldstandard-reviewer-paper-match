{"title": "On dynamic resource management mechanism using control theoretic approach for wide-area grid computing", "abstract": "In recent years, grid computing that integrates geographically distributed computing resources through communication networks captures the spotlight. Unlike parallel computing using conventional cluster computer systems, wide-area grid computing must resolve the following issues for effectively utilizing geographically distributed computing resources. First, since computing resources are shared by multiple users, the amount of available resources in a site changes over time. Second, since sites are geographically distributed, the transfer delay between sites cannot be neglected for computing resource management. For utilizing computing resources effectively, the amount of jobs injected into a site must be dynamically controlled according to the dynamically changing amount of available resources in sites. However, the transfer delay of a network is significant, so that it is not trivial for a resource allocation controller to quickly and dynamically adopt to the change in the amount of available resources in sites. In this paper, a dynamic resources management mechanism for wide-area grid computing called DRM-DC (dynamic resource management with delay compensator) based on control theory is proposed. The main feature of our DRM-DC is that it realizes high steady state and transient state performance in wide-area grid computing using a delay compensator called Smith predictor. Moreover, several discrete-time simulations using a Simgrid simulator are performed, and the effectiveness of our DRM-DC is demonstrated", "year": 2005, "ssId": "3ea5468e6d3007a94d4318932d7778693526145c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["H.
