{"title": "Floristic research of the mountains of Sterea Hellas (Central Greece) and their affinities with mountains of Peloponissos", "abstract": "The vascular flora of Mt Vardoussia comprises 1114 taxa, 557 of which are reported in this paper for the first time. The predominance of the Hemicryptophytes (45.3%) underlines the mountainous character of the flora. The examination of the floristic affinity between Mt Vardoussia and neighbouring mountains (Iti, Timfristos, Killini and Erimanthos) is assessed via the SAErensen coefficient.", "year": 2009, "ssId": "207c64b36fbd6accf7067366a251d071e8dd03a7", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andreas Vlachos", "T.
