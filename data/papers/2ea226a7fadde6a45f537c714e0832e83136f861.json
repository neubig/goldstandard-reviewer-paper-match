{"title": "Search-based Structured Prediction applied to Biomedical Event Extraction", "abstract": "We develop an approach to biomedical event extraction using a search-based structured prediction framework, SEARN, which converts the task into cost-sensitive classification tasks whose models are learned jointly. We show that SEARN improves on a simple yet strong pipeline by 8.6 points in F-score on the BioNLP 2009 shared task, while achieving the best reported performance by a joint inference method. Additionally, we consider the issue of cost estimation during learning and present an approach called focused costing that improves improves efficiency and predictive accuracy.", "year": 2011, "ssId": "2ea226a7fadde6a45f537c714e0832e83136f861", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andreas Vlachos", "M.
