{"title": "Balancing Shared Autonomy with Human-Robot Communication", "abstract": "Robotic agents that share autonomy with a human should leverage human domain knowledge and account for their preferences when completing a task. This extra knowledge can dramatically improve plan efficiency and user-satisfaction, but these gains are lost if communicating with a robot is taxing and unnatural. In this paper, we show how viewing humanrobot language through the lens of shared autonomy explains the efficiency versus cognitive load trade-offs humans make when deciding how cooperative and explicit to make their instructions.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "fa5c7406d09af3f06a3a7ead49975e3ee90ed584", "arXivId": "1805.07719", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07719.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Rosario Scalise", "Yonatan Bisk", "Maxwell Forbes", "Daqing Yi", "Yejin Choi", "S.
