{"title": "A Comparison of String Distance Metrics for Name-Matching Tasks", "abstract": "Using an open-source, Java toolkit of name-matching methods, we experimentally compare string distance metrics on the task of matching entity names. We investigate a number of different metrics proposed by different communities, including edit-distance metrics, fast heuristic string comparators, token-based distance metrics, and hybrid methods. Overall, the best-performing method is a hybrid scheme combining a TFIDF weighting scheme, which is widely used in information retrieval, with the Jaro-Winkler string-distance scheme, which was developed in the probabilistic record linkage community.", "year": 2003, "ssId": "9578679e028777dd709881f938114aa59fbbf481", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
