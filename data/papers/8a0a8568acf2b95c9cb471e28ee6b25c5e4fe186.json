{"title": "SenticNet 3: A Common and Common-Sense Knowledge Base for Cognition-Driven Sentiment Analysis", "abstract": "SenticNet is a publicly available semantic and affective resource for concept-level sentiment analysis. Rather than using graph-mining and dimensionality-reduction techniques, SenticNet 3 makes use of 'energy flows' to connect various parts of extended common and common-sense knowledge representations to one another. SenticNet 3 models nuanced semantics and sentics (that is, the conceptual and affective information associated with multi-word natural language expressions), representing information with a symbolic opacity of an intermediate nature between that of neural networks and typical symbolic systems.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "8a0a8568acf2b95c9cb471e28ee6b25c5e4fe186", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
