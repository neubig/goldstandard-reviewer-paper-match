{"title": "A Permutation-Based Model for Crowd Labeling: Optimal Estimation and Robustness", "abstract": "The task of aggregating and denoising crowd-labeled data has gained increased significance with the advent of crowdsourcing platforms and massive datasets. We propose a permutation-based model for crowd labeled data that is a significant generalization of the classical Dawid-Skene model, and introduce a new error metric by which to compare different estimators. We derive global minimax rates for the permutation-based model that are sharp up to logarithmic factors, and match the minimax lower bounds derived under the simpler Dawid-Skene model. We then design two computationally-efficient estimators: the WAN estimator for the setting where the ordering of workers in terms of their abilities is approximately known, and the OBI- WAN estimator where that is not known. For each of these estimators, we provide non-asymptotic bounds on their performance. We conduct synthetic simulations and experiments on real-world crowdsourcing data, and the experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "f9e32b30fd9ad50cce12ffb753c7be88100b6dc2", "arXivId": "1606.09632", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.09632.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Nihar B.
