{"title": "Statistical approach to perceived age control of singing voice", "abstract": "The perceived age of a singing voice is the age of the singer as perceived by the listener, and is one of the notable characteristics that determines perceptions of a song. Singers can sing expressively by controlling prosody and voice timbre, but the varieties of voice timbre that singers can produce are limited by physical constraints. Previous work has attempted to overcome the limitation through the use of statistical singing voice conversion. This technique makes it possible to convert singing voice timbre of an arbitrary source singer into those of an arbitrary target singer. However, it is still difficult to intuitively control singing voice characteristics by manipulating parameters corresponding to specific physical traits, such as gender and age. This paper presents our recent work on the development of a technique for controlling the voice timbre based on perceived age while maintaining the singer\u2019s individuality. The experimental results show that the proposed voice timbre control method makes it possible to change the singer\u2019s perceived age while not having an adverse effect on the perceived individuality.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "ff86133b3b49974f06fc881548c6f3c7a8ceffee", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["S.
