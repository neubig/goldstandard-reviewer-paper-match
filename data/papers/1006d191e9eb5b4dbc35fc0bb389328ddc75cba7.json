{"title": "ByT5: Towards a Token-Free Future with Pre-trained Byte-to-Byte Models", "abstract": "Abstract Most widely used pre-trained language models operate on sequences of tokens corresponding to word or subword units. By comparison, token-free models that operate directly on raw text (bytes or characters) have many benefits: They can process text in any language out of the box, they are more robust to noise, and they minimize technical debt by removing complex and error-prone text preprocessing pipelines. Because byte or character sequences are longer than token sequences, past work on token-free models has often introduced new model architectures designed to amortize the cost of operating directly on raw text. In this paper, we show that a standard Transformer architecture can be used with minimal modifications to process byte sequences. We characterize the trade-offs in terms of parameter count, training FLOPs, and inference speed, and show that byte-level models are competitive with their token-level counterparts. We also demonstrate that byte-level models are significantly more robust to noise and perform better on tasks that are sensitive to spelling and pronunciation. As part of our contribution, we release a new set of pre-trained byte-level Transformer models based on the T5 architecture, as well as all code and data used in our experiments.1", "year": 2021, "ssId": "1006d191e9eb5b4dbc35fc0bb389328ddc75cba7", "arXivId": "2105.13626", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13626.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Linting Xue", "Aditya Barua", "Noah Constant", "Rami Al-Rfou", "Sharan Narang", "Mihir Kale", "Adam Roberts", "Colin Raffel"]}
