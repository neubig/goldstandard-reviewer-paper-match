{"title": "Research note: Residents\u2019 Assessment of Local Government Information Systems", "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to analyze the intentions of users to use an information system by using a Web questionnaire survey (1036 local residents) conducted in March 2013. We use a theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM). The target information systems are the Websites of local governments. In order to make a comparison, we also report on the findings of user assessment of the Electronic Filing and Payment System national tax survey (e-Tax) conducted at the same time. Our results show that the combined factors of TAM, IS Success and residents\u2019 credibility are useful for system evaluation by residents of local governments.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "d74c5b5ed8eb467dc7f313b70a08880fcd74c39d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Shinji Watanabe"]}
