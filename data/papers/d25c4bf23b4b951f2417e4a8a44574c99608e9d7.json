{"title": "Robust time-frequency analysis of seismic data using general linear chirplet transform", "abstract": "Time-frequency analysis has been widely used in seismic processing and interpretation. A good time-frequency representation could preferably characterize geologic spatial distribution and detect hydrocarbon reservoir anomalies. This paper introduces a robust seismic time-frequency analysis method based on General Linear Chirplet Transform (GLCT). The GLCT method is an extended form of Linear Chirplet Transform (LCT), which is a unifying framework encompassing short time Fourier transform (STFT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) using chirplet atom as the base function instead of the sinusoidal wave or wavelets. By rotating the chirplet atom at each time-frequency point, GLCT method could adaptively choose the best atom to fit the local time-frequency feature of seismic signals. The algorithm follows such a simple logic and produces a broadband time-frequency spectrum free of cross-term interference, resulting in a good performance characterizing the instantaneous spectral variations.
