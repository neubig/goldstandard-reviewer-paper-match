{"title": "A Hybrid Approach to Electrolaryngeal Speech Enhancement Based on Spectral Compensation and Statistical Source Excitation Generation", "abstract": "We present a hybrid approach to improving naturalness of electrolaryngeal (EL) speech while minimizing degradation in listenability. An electrolarynx is a device that artificially generates excitation sounds to enable laryngectomees to produce EL speech. Although proficient laryngectomees can produce quite intelligible EL speech, it sounds very unnatural due to the mechanical excitation produced by the device. Moreover, the excitation sounds produced by the device often leak outside, adding noise to EL speech. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid method using the noise reduction method for enhancing spectral parameters and voice conversion method for predicting excitation parameters. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method yields significant improvements in naturalness compared with EL speech while keeping listenability high enough.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "7e0eb21f4903c2fe860d1c4f213879e99d7cd23c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Tanaka Kou", "T.
