{"title": "Biomedical Event Extraction without Training Data", "abstract": "We describe our system for the BioNLP 2009 event detection task. It is designed to be as domain-independent and unsupervised as possible. Nevertheless, the precisions achieved for single theme event classes range from 75% to 92%, while maintaining reasonable recall. The overall F-scores achieved were 36.44% and 30.80% on the development and the test sets respectively.", "year": 2009, "ssId": "872c2d9d8b27ff49367854a7cf67b5dff2010406", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andreas Vlachos", "P.
