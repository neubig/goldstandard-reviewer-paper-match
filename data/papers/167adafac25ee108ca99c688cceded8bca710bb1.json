{"title": "Size judgment at different distances as a function of age level.", "abstract": "Studies of constancy as a function of age have yielded inconsistent data. Size constancy represents a clear case in point. Various investigators (1, 2, 9) have found that size constancy increases with age while others have presented evidence that there is no such relationship (3, 4). Variations in experimental methodology and measurement techniques have made direct confirmation of theory and comparison of data impossible. The experiments differ considerably in the shape, size, and distance of stimuli, types of comparison made, instructions, and range of ages tested. Any one of these variables might well affect the outcome of a developmental study. In addition, very small samples and inadequate statistical analysis characterize most of the research in this field.", "year": 1958, "ssId": "167adafac25ee108ca99c688cceded8bca710bb1", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
