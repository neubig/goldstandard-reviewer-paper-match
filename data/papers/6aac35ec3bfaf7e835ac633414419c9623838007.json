{"title": "Combination of two-dimensional cochleogram and spectrogram features for deep learning-based ASR", "abstract": "This paper explores the use of auditory features based on cochleograms; two dimensional speech features derived from gammatone filters within the convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Furthermore, we also propose various possibilities to combine cochleogram features with log-mel filter banks or spectrogram features. In particular, we combine within low and high levels of CNN framework which we refer to as low-level and high-level feature combination. As comparison, we also construct the similar configuration with deep neural network (DNN). Performance was evaluated in the framework of hybrid neural network - hidden Markov model (NN-HMM) system on TIMIT phoneme sequence recognition task. The results reveal that cochleogram-spectrogram feature combination provides significant advantages. The best accuracy was obtained by high-level combination of two dimensional cochleogram-spectrogram features using CNN, achieved up to 8.2% relative phoneme error rate (PER) reduction from CNN single features or 19.7% relative PER reduction from DNN single features.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "6aac35ec3bfaf7e835ac633414419c9623838007", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andros Tjandra", "S.
