{"title": "Lexical Class Semantic Analysis", "abstract": "Semantic analysis of lexical classes is a funda- mental step of semantic analysis based on stochastic semantic parsing. The lexical class is a single word or a word group with specific semantic information such as dates, times, cities, etc. Having obtained a set of lexical classes, a semantic parse tree can be built upon it. This tree describes the relation between lexical classes and their appropriate superior concepts. This paper describes an implementation of a lexical class identification based on context-free grammars and parsing methods. The semantic analysis of lexical classes is based on grammars enriched with semantic tags. The main algorithm is described together with the experimental results. I. INTRODUCTION The human-computer communication is one of the most challenging topics of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Since speech is the most natural and the most common way of human communication, there is a need for using it as a communication medium between human and computer. The process of extracting the meaning from an utterance by a computer and storing the meaning in a computer model is called Natural Language Understanding (NLU). Semantic analysis is the first step of the NLU process. The goal of semantic analysis is to represent what the subject intended to say. Recent trends in the area of NLU are heading towards making all the processes stochastic. In a stochastic method of semantic parsing, semantic knowledge is usually represented by some kind of a tree.", "year": 2008, "ssId": "73e1dcf5f0f3cf4e645b0bba62d9b1e2ef47b706", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ivan Habernal"]}
