{"title": "Which Echo Chamber? Regions of Attraction in Learning with Decision-Dependent Distributions", "abstract": "As data-driven methods are deployed in real-world settings, the processes that generate the observed data will often react to the decisions of the learner. For example, a data source may have some incentive for the algorithm to provide a particular label (e.g. approve a bank loan), and manipulate their features accordingly. Work in strategic classification and decision-dependent distributions seeks to characterize the closed-loop behavior of deploying learning algorithms by explicitly considering the effect of the classifier on the underlying data distribution. More recently, works in performative prediction seek to classify the closed-loop behavior by considering general properties of the mapping from classifier to data distribution, rather than an explicit form. Building on this notion, we analyze repeated risk minimization as the perturbed trajectories of the gradient flows of performative risk minimization. We consider the case where there may be multiple local minimizers of performative risk, motivated by real world situations where the initial conditions may have significant impact on the long-term behavior of the system. As a motivating example, we consider a company whose current employee demographics affect the applicant pool they interview: the initial demographics of the company can affect the long-term hiring policies of the company. We provide sufficient conditions to characterize the region of attraction for the various equilibria in this settings. Additionally, we introduce the notion of performative alignment, which provides a geometric condition on the convergence of repeated risk minimization to performative risk minimizers.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "ba602ea9aaecab5a3ad243211f110ae7db4cc66a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Roy Dong", "L.
