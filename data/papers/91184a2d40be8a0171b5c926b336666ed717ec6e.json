{"title": "JCDL 2021 Tutorial on Systemic Challenges and Computational Solutions on Bias and Unfairness in Peer Review", "abstract": "Peer review is the backbone of scientific research and determines the composition of scientific digital libraries. Any systemic issues in peer review - such as biases or fraud - can systematically affect the resulting scientific digital library as well as any analyses on that library. They also affect billions of dollars in research grants made via peer review as well as entire careers of researchers. The tutorial will discuss various systemic issues in peer review via insightful experiments, several computational solutions proposed to address these issues, and a number of important open problems. A detailed writeup on the topics of this tutorial as well as a complete list of references is available in [1].", "year": 2021, "ssId": "91184a2d40be8a0171b5c926b336666ed717ec6e", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nihar B.
