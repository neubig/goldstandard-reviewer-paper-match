{"title": "Secure network coding for distributed secret sharing with low communication cost", "abstract": "Shamir's (n, k) threshold secret sharing is an important component of several cryptographic protocols, such as those for secure multiparty-computation. These protocols typically assume the presence of direct communication links from the dealer to all participants, in which case the dealer can directly pass the shares of the secret to every participant. In this paper, we consider the problem of secret sharing when the dealer does not have direct communication links to all participants, and instead, they form a general network. We present an algorithm for secret sharing over networks that satisfy what we call the k-propagating-dealer condition. The algorithm is communication-efficient, distributed and deterministic. Interestingly, the solution constitutes an instance of a network coding problem admitting a distributed and deterministic solution, and furthermore, handles the case of nodal-eavesdropping, about which very little appears to be known in the literature. In the second part of the paper, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on the communication complexity of secret sharing over any network, which may also be of independent interest. We show that for networks satisfying the k-propagating-dealer condition, the communication complexity of our algorithm is \u0398(n), and furthermore, is always within a constant factor of the lower bound. We also show that, in contrast, existing solutions in the literature entail a communication-complexity that is superlinear for a wide class of networks, and is \u0398(n2) in the worst case. Our algorithm thus allows for efficient generalization of several cryptographic protocols to a large class of networks.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "63bfe58735f44b0af24da3c2cb6b1651b001b83c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nihar B.
