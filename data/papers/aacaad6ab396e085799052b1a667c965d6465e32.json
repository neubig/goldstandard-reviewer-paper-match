{"title": "Role of Disulfide Bonds and Sulfhydryl Blocked by N-Ethylmaleimide on the Properties of Different Protein-Stabilized Emulsions", "abstract": "To investigate the role of sulfhydryl groups and disulfide bonds in different protein-stabilized emulsions, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was used as a sulfhydryl-blocking agent added in the emulsion. The addition of NEM to block the sulfhydryl groups resulted in a reduction in disulfide bond formation, which enabled the internal structure of the protein molecule to be destroyed, and then decreased the restriction of protein membrane on the oil droplets. Furthermore, with the NEM content increasing in the emulsion, a reduction in the protein emulsifying activity and emulsion stability also occurred. At the same time, the intermolecular interaction of the protein on the oil droplet interface membrane was destroyed, and the emulsion droplet size increased with the NEM content in the emulsion. Although NEM blocking sulfhydryl groups from forming disulfide bonds has similar effects on three types of protein emulsion, the degree of myofibrillar protein (MP), egg-white protein isolate (EPI), and soybean protein isolate (SPI) used as emulsifiers had a subtle difference.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "aacaad6ab396e085799052b1a667c965d6465e32", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Mangang Wu", "Zhikun Li", "Ranran Wei", "Yi Luan", "Juan Hu", "Qingling Wang", "Rui Liu", "Qingfeng Ge", "Hai Yu"]}
