{"title": "Neural Query Language: A Knowledge Base Query Language for Tensorflow", "abstract": "Large knowledge bases (KBs) are useful for many AI tasks, but are difficult to integrate into modern gradient-based learning systems. Here we describe a framework for accessing soft symbolic database using only differentiable operators. For example, this framework makes it easy to conveniently write neural models that adjust confidences associated with facts in a soft KB; incorporate prior knowledge in the form of hand-coded KB access rules; or learn to instantiate query templates using information extracted from text. NQL can work well with KBs with millions of tuples and hundreds of thousands of entities on a single GPU.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "9f1059006e4ba303f8945114eddadd50d58a9f3e", "arXivId": "1905.06209", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06209.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["William W.
