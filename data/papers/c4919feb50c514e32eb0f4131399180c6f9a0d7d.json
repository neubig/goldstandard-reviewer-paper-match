{"title": "Function Design for Improved Competitive Ratio in Online Resource Allocation with Procurement Costs", "abstract": "We study the problem of online resource allocation, where multiple customers arrive sequentially and the seller must irrevocably allocate resources to each incoming customer while also facing a procurement cost for the total allocation. Assuming resource procurement follows an a priori known marginally increasing cost function, the objective is to maximize the reward obtained from fulfilling the customers\u2019 requests sans the cumulative procurement cost. We analyze the competitive ratio of a primal-dual algorithm in this setting, and develop an optimization framework for synthesizing a surrogate function for the procurement cost function to be used by the algorithm, in order to improve the competitive ratio of the primal-dual algorithm. Our first design method focuses on polynomial procurement cost functions and uses the optimal surrogate function to provide a more refined bound than the state of the art. Our second design method uses quasiconvex optimization to find optimal design parameters for a general class of procurement cost functions. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the design techniques. We conclude by extending the analysis to devise a posted pricing mechanism in which the algorithm does not require the customers\u2019 preferences to be revealed.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "c4919feb50c514e32eb0f4131399180c6f9a0d7d", "arXivId": "2012.12457", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12457.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Mitas Ray", "Omid Sadeghi", "L.
