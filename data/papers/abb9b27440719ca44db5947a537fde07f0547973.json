{"title": "Explicit codes uniformly reducing repair bandwidth in distributed storage", "abstract": "A distributed storage setting is considered where a file of size B is to be stored across n storage nodes. A data collector should be able to reconstruct the entire data by downloading the symbols stored in any k nodes. When a node fails, it is replaced by a new node by downloading data from some of the existing nodes. The amount of download is termed as repair bandwidth. One way to implement such a system is to store one fragment of an (n, k) MDS code in each node, in which case the repair bandwidth is B. Since repair of a failed node consumes network bandwidth, codes reducing repair bandwidth are of great interest. Most of the recent work in this area focuses on reducing the repair bandwidth of a set of k nodes which store the data in uncoded form, while the reduction in the repair bandwidth of the remaining nodes is only marginal. In this paper, we present an explicit code which reduces the repair bandwidth for all the nodes to approximately B/2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit code which reduces the repair bandwidth of all the nodes for all feasible values of the system parameters.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "abb9b27440719ca44db5947a537fde07f0547973", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nihar B.
