{"title": "Pretraining by Backtranslation for End-to-End ASR in Low-Resource Settings", "abstract": "We explore training attention-based encoder-decoder ASR in low-resource settings. These models perform poorly when trained on small amounts of transcribed speech, in part because they depend on having sufficient target-side text to train the attention and decoder networks. In this paper we address this shortcoming by pretraining our network parameters using only text-based data and transcribed speech from other languages. We analyze the relative contributions of both sources of data. Across 3 test languages, our text-based approach resulted in a 20% average relative improvement over a text-based augmentation technique without pretraining. Using transcribed speech from nearby languages gives a further 20-30% relative reduction in character error rate.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "bd8922f8cc8284553dc9e6db529af309298451fe", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Matthew Wiesner", "Adithya Renduchintala", "Shinji Watanabe", "Chunxi Liu", "Najim Dehak", "S.
