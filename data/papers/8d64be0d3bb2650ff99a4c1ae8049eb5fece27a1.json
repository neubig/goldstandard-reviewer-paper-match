{"title": "Bottleneck Features for Emotional Speech Recognition", "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is used for emotional speech. However emotion infulence speech signal. Therefore emotional speech degrades ASR quality. In this study, we focus on bottleneck features for emotional speech recognition. The bottleneck features are made by deep neural network hidden layer which has small number nodes than other layer. We think bottoleneck sturucture can extract features and bottleneck features represent phoneme essential features. By using bottleneck features for emotional speech recognition, we confirm improvement results compared with emotion adaptation model and normal model.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "8d64be0d3bb2650ff99a4c1ae8049eb5fece27a1", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kohei Mukaihara", "S.
