{"title": "Explicit and optimal exact-regenerating codes for the minimum-bandwidth point in distributed storage", "abstract": "In the distributed storage setting that we consider, data is stored across n nodes in the network such that the data can be recovered by connecting to any subset of k nodes. Additionally, one can repair a failed node by connecting to any d nodes while downloading \u03b2 units of data from each. Dimakis et al. show that the repair bandwidth d\u03b2 can be considerably reduced if each node stores slightly more than the minimum required and characterize the tradeoff between the amount of storage per node and the repair bandwidth.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "88e2beccbc89b3e3dd793e2502b17c1fa551151d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["K.
