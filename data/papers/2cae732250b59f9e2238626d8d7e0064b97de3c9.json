{"title": "A stabilized zero-crossing representation in the wavelet transform domain and its extension to image representation for early vision", "abstract": "We present a new stabilized zero-crossing representation with a salient feature that the signal reconstruction problem reduces to a typical minimum-norm optimization problem, the solution of which is formulated as a linear simultaneous equation, and develop an iterative algorithm for signal reconstruction. Moreover, we extend them to the two-dimensional case. With the extended two-dimensional reconstruction algorithm we can almost perfectly reconstruct an original image from the stabilized two-dimensional zero-crossing representation, and after some dozens of iterations the algorithm provides a reconstructed image with subjectively high picture quality. Furthermore, we introduce a threshold operation based on edge intensity to reduce the amount of information in the stabilized zero-crossing representation, and experimentally demonstrate that the threshold operation works well.", "year": 1996, "ssId": "2cae732250b59f9e2238626d8d7e0064b97de3c9", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Shinji Watanabe", "T.
