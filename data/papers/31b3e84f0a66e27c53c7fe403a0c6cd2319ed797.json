{"title": "TensorLog: A Probabilistic Database Implemented Using Deep-Learning Infrastructure", "abstract": "We present an implementation of a probabilistic first-order logic called TensorLog, in which classes of logical queries are compiled into differentiable functions in a neuralnetwork infrastructure such as Tensorflow or Theano. This leads to a close integration of probabilistic logical reasoning with deep-learning infrastructure: in particular, it enables high-performance deep learning frameworks to be used for tuning the parameters of a probabilistic logic. The integration with these frameworks enables use of GPU-based parallel processors for inference and learning, making TensorLog the first highly parallellizable probabilistic logic. Experimental results show that TensorLog scales to problems involving hundreds of thousands of knowledge-base triples and tens of thousands of examples.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "31b3e84f0a66e27c53c7fe403a0c6cd2319ed797", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
