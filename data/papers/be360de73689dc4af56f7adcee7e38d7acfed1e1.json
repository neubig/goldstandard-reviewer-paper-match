{"title": "List Aggregation of Ranked Preferences", "abstract": "We consider the problem of aggregating a given set of orderings (rankings) into a (smaller) set of aggregate orderings that maintains certain properties such as fairness. Classical results such as Arrow\u2019s impossibility theorem show the impossibility of doing so with just one aggregate ordering. This work thus considers doing so with a \u2018list\u2019 of aggregate orderings, and in particular, with a list of the smallest possible size, under a (stronger) notion of fairness. Upper and lower bounds on the size of such a list are derived, and these bounds are a logarithmic factor away from each other. The algorithm presented for aggregating these orderings also forms the basis of a new game \u2018Match to Race\u2019 available online.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "be360de73689dc4af56f7adcee7e38d7acfed1e1", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nihar B.
