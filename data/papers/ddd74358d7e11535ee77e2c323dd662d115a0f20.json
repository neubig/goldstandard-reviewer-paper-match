{"title": "Few-shot Object Grounding and Mapping for Natural Language Robot Instruction Following", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning a robot policy to follow natural language instructions that can be easily extended to reason about new objects. We introduce a few-shot language-conditioned object grounding method trained from augmented reality data that uses exemplars to identify objects and align them to their mentions in instructions. We present a learned map representation that encodes object locations and their instructed use, and construct it from our few-shot grounding output. We integrate this mapping approach into an instruction-following policy, thereby allowing it to reason about previously unseen objects at test-time by simply adding exemplars. We evaluate on the task of learning to map raw observations and instructions to continuous control of a physical quadcopter. Our approach significantly outperforms the prior state of the art in the presence of new objects, even when the prior approach observes all objects during training.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "ddd74358d7e11535ee77e2c323dd662d115a0f20", "arXivId": "2011.07384", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07384.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Valts Blukis", "Ross A.
