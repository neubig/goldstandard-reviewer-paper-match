{"title": "A Tale of Two Entity Linking and Discovery Systems", "abstract": "The long-term research agenda of our group is to evaluate the potential of probabilistic logics for complex, large-scale problems which require data resources naturally encoded as relations. In pursuit of this goal, we compared two systems for performing automated entity discovery and linking in English-language text, as submitted to the 2014 TAC Knowledge Base Population Entity Discovery and Linking (EDL) track. Both systems are based on random-walk strategies for measuring similarity within graphs. The first system is PageReactor, a hand-engineering system originally designed for task of wikification. The second is based on ProPPR, a probabilistic logic programming language.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "1ae1850bcfa3c31d7bc828cc33f7dd3926cee26f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kathryn Mazaitis", "Richard C.
