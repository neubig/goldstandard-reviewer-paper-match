{"title": "Adaptive Constraint Satisfaction for Markov Decision Process Congestion Games: Application to Transportation Networks", "abstract": "Under the Markov decision process (MDP) congestion game framework, we study the problem of enforcing population distribution constraints on a population of players with stochastic dynamics and coupled congestion costs. Existing research demonstrates that the constraints on the players\u2019 population distribution can be satisfied by enforcing tolls. However, to compute the minimum toll value for constraint satisfaction requires accurate modeling of the player\u2019s congestion costs. Motivated by settings where an accurate congestion cost model is unavailable (e.g. transportation networks), we consider a MDP congestion game with unknown congestion costs. We assume that a constraint-enforcing authority can repeatedly enforce tolls on a population of players who converges to an -optimal population distribution for any given toll. We then construct a myopic update algorithm to compute the minimum toll value while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied on average. We analyze how the players\u2019 sub-optimal responses to tolls impact the rates of convergence towards the minimum toll value and constraint satisfaction. Finally, we apply our results to transportation by building a high-fidelity game model using data from the New York City\u2019s (NYC) Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), and illustrate how to efficiently reduce congestion while minimizing the impact on driver earnings.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "aeffb61024e5ccac5021ca0bf9d199d9196a0521", "arXivId": "1907.08912", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08912.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Sarah H.
