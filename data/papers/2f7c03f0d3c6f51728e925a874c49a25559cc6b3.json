{"title": "End-to-End Multihop Retrieval for Compositional Question Answering over Long Documents", "abstract": "Answering complex questions from long documents requires aggregating multiple pieces of evidence and then predicting the answers. In this paper, we propose a multihop retrieval method, DOCHOPPER, to answer compositional questions over long documents. At each step, DOCHOPPER retrieves a paragraph or sentence embedding from the document, mixes the retrieved result with the query, and updates the query for the next step. In contrast to many other retrieval-based methods (e.g., RAG or REALM) the query is not augmented with a token sequence: instead, it is augmented by \u201cnumerically\u201d combining it with another neural representation. This means that model is end-to-end differentiable. We demonstrate that utilizing document structure in this was can largely improve question-answering and retrieval performance on long documents. We experimented with DOCHOPPER on three different QA tasks that require reading long documents to answer compositional questions: discourse entailment reasoning, factual QA with table and text, and information seeking QA from academic papers. DOCHOPPER outperforms all baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. Additionally, DOCHOPPER is efficient at inference time, being 3\u223c10 times faster than the baselines.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "2f7c03f0d3c6f51728e925a874c49a25559cc6b3", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Haitian Sun", "William W.
