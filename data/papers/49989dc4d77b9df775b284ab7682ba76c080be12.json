{"title": "CS 543 : Final Project Report Texture Classification using 2-D Noncausal HMMs", "abstract": "We implement a texture classification algorithm using 2-D Noncausal Hidden Markov Models. As with many of the various classification algorithms that were studied in the course, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) assume an underlying structure to the object to be classified. Classifiers that follow this approach include the articulated parts models for classifying deformable objects, or the sliding window approach where a statistical template encodes the structure. However, unlike these classifiers, HMMs simply provide a basis on which the underlying structure of the object is to be estimated from observations as opposed to specifically defined. This doubly-stochastic approach has been used in areas such as speech recognition and video event classification where the process to be measured is well modeled by both a hidden and an observed component [1][2].", "year": 2012, "ssId": "49989dc4d77b9df775b284ab7682ba76c080be12", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Felix Wang", "J.
