{"title": "Ethical Considerations in Artificial Intelligence Courses", "abstract": "The recent surge in interest in ethics in artificial intelligence may leave many educators wondering how to address moral, ethical, and philosophical issues in their AI courses. As instructors we want to develop curriculum that not only prepares students to be artificial intelligence practitioners, but also to understand the moral, ethical, and philosophical impacts that artificial intelligence will have on society. In this article we provide practical case studies and links to resources for use by AI educators. We also provide concrete suggestions on how to integrate AI ethics into a general artificial intelligence course and how to teach a stand-alone artificial intelligence ethics course.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "57026b2d45fa59c6326b5a1d2e27626403f083ba", "arXivId": "1701.07769", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07769.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Emanuelle Burton", "J.
