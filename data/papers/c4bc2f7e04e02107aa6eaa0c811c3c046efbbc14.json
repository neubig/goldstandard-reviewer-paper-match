{"title": "Hardness Results for Learning First-Order Representations and Programming by Demonstration", "abstract": "Learning from \u201cstructured examples\u201d is necessary in a number of settings, including inductive logic programming. Here we analyze a simple learning problem in which examples have non-trivial structure: specifically, a learning problem in which concepts are strings over a fixed alphabet, examples are deterministic finite automata (DFAs), and a string represents the set of all DFAs that accept it. We show that solving this \u201cdual\u201d DFA learning problem is hard, under cryptographic assumptions. This result implies the hardness of several other more natural learning problems, including learning the description logic CLASSSIC from subconcepts, and learning arity-two \u201cdeterminate\u201d function-free Prolog clauses from ground clauses. The result also implies the hardness of two formal problems related to the area of \u201cprogramming by demonstration\u201d: learning straightline programs over a fixed operator set from input-output pairs, and learning straightline programs from input-output pairs and \u201cpartial traces\u201d.", "year": 2004, "ssId": "c4bc2f7e04e02107aa6eaa0c811c3c046efbbc14", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
