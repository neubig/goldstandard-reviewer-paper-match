{"title": "Improving Robustness of Machine Translation with Synthetic Noise", "abstract": "Modern Machine Translation (MT) systems perform remarkably well on clean, in-domain text. However most of the human generated text, particularly in the realm of social media, is full of typos, slang, dialect, idiolect and other noise which can have a disastrous impact on the accuracy of MT. In this paper we propose methods to enhance the robustness of MT systems by emulating naturally occurring noise in otherwise clean data. Synthesizing noise in this manner we are ultimately able to make a vanilla MT system more resilient to naturally occurring noise, partially mitigating loss in accuracy resulting therefrom.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "bdbf635476477eec5be5a292b494e20b8902cc35", "arXivId": "1902.09508", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09508.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Vaibhav", "Sumeet Singh", "Craig Stewart", "Graham Neubig"]}
