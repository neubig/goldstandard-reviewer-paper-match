{"title": "Information-Theoretically Secure Erasure Codes for Distributed Storage", "abstract": "Repair operations in erasure-coded distributed storage systems involve a lot of data movement. This can potentially expose data to malicious acts of passive eavesdroppers or active adversaries, putting security of the system at risk. This paper presents coding schemes and repair algorithms that ensure security of the data in the presence of passive eavesdroppers and active adversaries while maintaining high availability, reliability, and resource efficiency in the system. The proposed codes are optimal in that they meet previously proposed lower bounds on storage and network-bandwidth requirements for a wide range of system parameters. The results thus establish the secure storage capacity of such systems. The proposed codes are based on an optimal class of codes called product-matrix codes. The constructions presented for security from active adversaries provide an additional appealing feature of \u201con-demand security,\u201d where the desired level of security can be chosen separately for each instance of repair, and the proposed algorithms remain optimal simultaneously for all possible security levels. This paper also provides necessary and sufficient conditions governing the transformation of any (non-secure) code into one providing on-demand security.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "8de431e0e62653711136836642af38179731c2f0", "arXivId": "1508.03787", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.03787.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["K.
