{"title": "An Unsupervised Model for Joint Phrase Alignment and Extraction", "abstract": "We present an unsupervised model for joint phrase alignment and extraction using non-parametric Bayesian methods and inversion transduction grammars (ITGs). The key contribution is that phrases of many granularities are included directly in the model through the use of a novel formulation that memorizes phrases generated not only by terminal, but also non-terminal symbols. This allows for a completely probabilistic model that is able to create a phrase table that achieves competitive accuracy on phrase-based machine translation tasks directly from unaligned sentence pairs. Experiments on several language pairs demonstrate that the proposed model matches the accuracy of traditional two-step word alignment/phrase extraction approach while reducing the phrase table to a fraction of the original size.", "year": 2011, "ssId": "4abdea830316d80ab0b29fb94ee0786216f6a1cd", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Graham Neubig", "Taro Watanabe", "E.
