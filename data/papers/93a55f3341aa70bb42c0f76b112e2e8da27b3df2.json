{"title": "Response Selection on EBDM-Dialogue System based on Entrainment Analysis", "abstract": "Entrainment is a factor in dialogue that affects not only human-human dialogue but also human-machine interaction. While the entrainment on the lexical level is well documented, less is known about how entrainment affects dialogue on a more abstract, and structural level. In previous works, we investigated the effect of entrainment on lexical choice given dialogue acts. From these results, we build the example selection on the EBDM dialogue system that would like to entrain with users in a similar manner.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "93a55f3341aa70bb42c0f76b112e2e8da27b3df2", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Graham Neubig", "Masahiro Nakamura"]}
