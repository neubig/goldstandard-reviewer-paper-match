{"title": "False News Detection on Social Media", "abstract": "Social media has become a major information platform where people consume and share news. However, it has also enabled the wide dissemination of false news, i.e., news posts published on social media that are verifiably false, causing significant negative effects on society. In order to help prevent further propagation of false news on social media, we set up this competition to motivate the development of automated real-time false news detection approaches. Specifically, this competition includes three sub-tasks: false-news text detection, false-news image detection and false-news multi-modal detetcion, which aims to motivate participants to further explore the efficiency of multiple modalities in detecting false news and reasonable fusion approaches of multi-modal contents. To better support this competition, we also construct and publicize a multi-modal data repository about False News on Weibo Social platform(MCG-FNeWS}) to help evaluate the performance of different approaches from participants.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "a8c62c42509c45a708ba477b603ee3fb81c77056", "arXivId": "1908.10818", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10818.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Juan Cao", "Qiang Sheng", "Peng Qi", "L.
