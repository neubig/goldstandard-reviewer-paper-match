{"title": "Illinois Cognitive Computation Group UI-CCG TAC 2013 Entity Linking and Slot Filler Validation Systems", "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the University of Illinois (UI CCG) submission to the 2013 TAC KBP English Entity Linking (EL) and Slot Filler Validation (SFV) tasks. We developed two separate systems. Our Entity Linking system integrates an improved version of the Illinois Wikifier with additional functionality to identify and cluster entity mentions that do not correspond to entries in the reference knowledge base. Our Slot Filler Validation system follows an entailment formulation that evaluates each candidate answer based on the evidence present in the source document it refers to.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "26c65dad79da20aa67df21a6c10e509a964f0841", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Xiao Cheng", "Bingling Chen", "Rajhans Samdani", "Kai-Wei Chang", "Zhiye Fei", "M.
