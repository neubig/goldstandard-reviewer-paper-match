{"title": "Bifurcated Backbone Strategy for RGB-D Salient Object Detection", "abstract": "Multi-level feature fusion is a fundamental topic in computer vision. It has been exploited to detect, segment and classify objects at various scales. When multi-level features meet multi-modal cues, the optimal feature aggregation and multi-modal learning strategy become a hot potato. In this paper, we leverage the inherent multi-modal and multi-level nature of RGB-D salient object detection to devise a novel Bifurcated Backbone Strategy Network (BBS-Net). Our architecture, is simple, efficient, and backbone-independent. In particular, first, we propose to regroup the multi-level features into teacher and student features using a bifurcated backbone strategy (BBS). Second, we introduce a depth-enhanced module (DEM) to excavate informative depth cues from the channel and spatial views. Then, RGB and depth modalities are fused in a complementary way. Extensive experiments show that BBS-Net significantly outperforms 18 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on eight challenging datasets under five evaluation measures, demonstrating the superiority of our approach (~4% improvement in S-measure $vs$ . the top-ranked model: DMRA). In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis on the generalization ability of different RGB-D datasets and provide a powerful training set for future research.
