{"title": "Iterative Entity Alignment via Knowledge Embeddings", "abstract": "Entity alignment aims to link entities and their counterparts among multiple knowledge graphs (KGs). Most existing methods typically rely on external information of entities such as Wikipedia links and require costly manual feature construction to complete alignment. In this paper, we present a novel approach for entity alignment via joint knowledge embeddings. Our method jointly encodes both entities and relations of various KGs into a unified low-dimensional semantic space according to a small seed set of aligned entities. During this process, we can align entities according to their semantic distance in this joint semantic space. More specifically, we present an iterative and parameter sharing method to improve alignment performance. Experiment results on realworld datasets show that, as compared to baselines, our method achieves significant improvements on entity alignment, and can further improve knowledge graph completion performance on various KGs with the favor of joint knowledge embeddings.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "f75e691daae9133941c9a083e319b39bd837d456", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Hao Zhu", "Ruobing Xie", "Zhiyuan Liu", "Maosong Sun"]}
