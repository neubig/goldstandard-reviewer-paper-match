{"title": "Non-Audible Murmur Enhancement Method using Air- and Body-Conductive Microphones in Noisy Environments and its Evaluation", "abstract": "As one of the silent speech interfaces, Non-Audible Murmur (NAM) microphone which can detect an extremely soft whispered voice has been developed. Although NAM is a promising medium for silent speech communication, its intelligibility and naturalness are significantly degraded by acoustic changes caused by body-conductive recording. To address this issue, several enhancement methods based on statistical voice conversion techniques have been proposed, and their effectiveness has been confirmed in quiet environments. However, it can be expected that NAM will be used not only in quiet, but also in noisy environments, and it is thus necessary to develop enhancement methods that will also work in these cases. In this report, we propose a framework for NAM enhancement using the NAM microphone and an air-conductive microphone. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of significantly improving enhancement performance in noisy environments by considering not only the effect of noise contamination but also speaking style changes caused by the noise.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "579e01c3c864cc98e57c728f84fcf553c5b1bcba", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Tajiri Yusuke", "Tanaka Kou", "T.
