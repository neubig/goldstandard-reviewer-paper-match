{"title": "Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields for Information Extraction", "abstract": "We describe semi-Markov conditional random fields (semi-CRFs), a conditionally trained version of semi-Markov chains. Intuitively, a semi-CRF on an input sequence x outputs a \"segmentation\" of x, in which labels are assigned to segments (i.e., subsequences) of x rather than to individual elements xi of x. Importantly, features for semi-CRFs can measure properties of segments, and transitions within a segment can be non-Markovian. In spite of this additional power, exact learning and inference algorithms for semi-CRFs are polynomial-time\u2014often only a small constant factor slower than conventional CRFs. In experiments on five named entity recognition problems, semi-CRFs generally outperform conventional CRFs.", "year": 2004, "ssId": "135ace829b6ad2ec9db040d8e5fd137034e83665", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Sunita Sarawagi", "William W.
