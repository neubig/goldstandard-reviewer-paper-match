{"title": "Study on Word-Level Emphasis Across English and Japanese \u2217 \u2606", "abstract": "Speech-to-speech (S2S) translation systems [1] allow us to communicate with other people in different languages. However, conventional S2S systems ignore emphasis, which is an important factor of paralinguistic information. In order to construct a S2S system considering emphasis, it is important to study on how emphasis is expressed in each language and also across languages. In this paper, we analyzed emphasis is word-level. We first estimate a real-numbered value of word-level emphasis using many speech features such as F0, duration and power. Based on this estimation we perform an analysis of how emphasis is expressed in individual languages and also across languages.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "b2b0fbf9033f1c36bea8bb11c173f14378c60db9", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["D.
