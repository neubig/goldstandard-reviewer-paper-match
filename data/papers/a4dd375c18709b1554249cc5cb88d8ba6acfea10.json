{"title": "Machine Translation -- Why couldn't we do it? Why are we starting to be able to now?", "abstract": "Abstract While machine translation has been a long-held dream dating back to the appearance of the first computers, for many years it had not reached a level that was able to stand up to real use. However, over the past ten or so years, there have been huge advances in the technology, and machine translation is finally seeing large-scale use in real situations. This paper describes 5 major elements that have contributed to these enormous steps forward in machine translation systems.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "a4dd375c18709b1554249cc5cb88d8ba6acfea10", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Graham Neubig"]}
