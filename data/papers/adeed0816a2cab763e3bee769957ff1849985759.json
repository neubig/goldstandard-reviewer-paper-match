{"title": "(Semi-)Automatic Normalization of Historical Texts using Distance Measures and the Norma tool", "abstract": "Historical texts typically show a high degree of variance in spelling. Normalization of variant word forms to their modern spellings can greatly benefit further processing of the data, e.g., POS tagging or lemmatization. This paper compares several approaches to normalization with a focus on methods based on string distance measures and evaluates them on two different types of historical texts. Furthermore, the Norma tool is introduced, an interactive normalization tool which is flexibly adaptable to different varieties of historical language data. It is shown that a combination of normalization methods produces the best results, achieving an accuracy between 74% and 94% depending on the type of text.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "adeed0816a2cab763e3bee769957ff1849985759", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Marcel Bollmann"]}
