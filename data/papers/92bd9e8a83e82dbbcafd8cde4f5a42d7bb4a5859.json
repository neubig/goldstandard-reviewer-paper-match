{"title": "Language Model Adaptation and Analysis for Individuality Transforming \u6c34\u4e0a \u96c5\u535a", "abstract": "In text and speech, there are various features that express the individuality of the writer or speaker. We proposed a method for transforming individuality using a technique inspired by statistical machine translation (SMT), and showed the effectiveness. In previous work, we proposed a method for paraphrasing for characteristic words using n-gram clustering. However, the method can be improved, because it considers only short context. In this paper, we propose a model of transforming individuality that considers longer contexts. To achieve this, we suggest adaptation of the language models and expansion of paraphrasing for characteristic words.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "92bd9e8a83e82dbbcafd8cde4f5a42d7bb4a5859", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["M.
