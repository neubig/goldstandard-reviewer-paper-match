{"title": "Review of who's #1?: the science of ranking and rating by Amy N. Langville and Carl D. Meyer", "abstract": "This book comprises a solid introductory through intermediate text on the science of rating and ranking. The field of ranking and rating has been receiving increasing attention in the last several years due to its application in a myriad of areas from movie recommendations to selecting matchups in sports tournaments. The central question of the field is, given a list of traits about a set of entities (movies, sports teams etc.) how do we assemble a ranking (strict linear order) of the entities. There are many ways to achieve a ranking, a myriad of tuning parameters for each method, and various overall measures of accuracy. The book covers the science behind the methods and the art behind the tuning with equal gusto and provides many insightful asides to the text including examples, pitfalls, and historical notes about this rich and complex subject. This book is a great introduction to the field (including its constituent parts in linear algebra and data mining) and contains enough depth to be used as a supplemental book in a data mining course or as a jumping off point for an interested researcher.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "68f2f32e0e8fc868920971077a11042784be2616", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nicholas Mattei"]}
