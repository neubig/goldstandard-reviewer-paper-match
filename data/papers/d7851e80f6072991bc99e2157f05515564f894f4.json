{"title": "Structured Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors for a Robust Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion Model", "abstract": "Grapheme-to-phoneme (g2p) conversion, used to estimate the pronunciations of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, is a highly important part of recognition systems, as well as text-to-speech systems. The current state-of-the-art approach in g2p conversion is structured learning based on the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA), which is an online discriminative training method for multiclass classification. However, it is known that the aggressive weight update method of MIRA is prone to overfitting, even if the current example is an outlier or noisy. Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors (AROW) has been proposed to resolve this problem for binary classification. In addition, AROW\u2019s update rule is simpler and more efficient than that of MIRA, allowing for more efficient training. Although AROW has these advantages, it has not been applied to g2p conversion yet. In this paper, we first apply AROW on g2p conversion task which is structured learning problem. In an evaluation that employed a dataset generated from the collective knowledge on the Web, our proposed approach achieves a 6.8% error reduction rate compared to MIRA in terms of phoneme error rate. Also the learning time of our proposed approach was shorter than that of MIRA in almost datasets. key words: g2p conversion, out-of-vocabulary word, online discriminative training, structured learning, AROW", "year": 2014, "ssId": "d7851e80f6072991bc99e2157f05515564f894f4", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Keigo Kubo", "S.
