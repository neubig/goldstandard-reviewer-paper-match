{"title": "A pattern recognition device and pattern recognition methods", "abstract": "there is provided a pattern recognition apparatus for generating a plurality of systems, and combination of the plurality of systems to improve the recognition performance, comprising a discriminative training session for the construction of model parameters of a second or subsequent system based on an output tendency of a previously constructed model so that it is the previously from the output tendency constructed model differs. When multiple systems are combined together, therefore, the detection performance can be improved.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "626f8a50a7bd24d869f25bddb6fbaa59b090268c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yuki Tachioka", "Shinji Watanabe"]}
