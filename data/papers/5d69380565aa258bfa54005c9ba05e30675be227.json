{"title": "Hierarchical Semi-supervised Classification with Incomplete Class Hierarchies", "abstract": "In an entity classification task, topic or concept hierarchies are often incomplete. Previous work by Dalvi et al. [12] has showed that in non-hierarchical semi-supervised classification tasks, the presence of such unanticipated classes can cause semantic drift for seeded classes. The Exploratory learning [12] method was proposed to solve this problem; however it is limited to the flat classification task. This paper builds such exploratory learning methods for hierarchical classification tasks. We experimented with subsets of the NELL [8] ontology and text, and HTML table datasets derived from the ClueWeb09 corpus. Our method (OptDAC-ExploreEM) outperforms the existing Exploratory EM method, and its naive extension (DAC-ExploreEM), in terms of seed class F1 on average by 10% and 7% respectively.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "5d69380565aa258bfa54005c9ba05e30675be227", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Bhavana Dalvi", "A.
