{"title": "A Unifying Framework for Combining Complementary Strengths of Humans and ML toward Better Predictive Decision-Making", "abstract": "Hybrid human-ML systems are increasingly in charge of consequential decisions in a wide range of domains. A growing body of work has advanced our understanding of these systems by providing empirical and theoretical analyses. However, existing empirical results are mixed, and theoretical proposals are often incompatible with each other. Our goal in this work is to bring much-needed organization to this field by offering a unifying framework for understanding conditions under which combining complementary strengths of human and ML leads to higher quality decisions than those produced by them individually\u2014a state to which we refer to as human-ML complementarity. We focus specifically on the context of human-ML predictive decision-making systems and investigate optimal ways of combining human and ML-based predictive decisions, accounting for the underlying causes of variation in their judgments. Within this scope, we present two crucial contributions. First, drawing upon prior literature in human psychology, machine learning, and human-computer interaction, we introduce a taxonomy characterizing a wide variety of criteria across which human and machine decision-making differ. Building on our taxonomy, our second contribution presents a unifying optimizationbased framework for formalizing how human and ML predictive decisions should be aggregated optimally. We show that our proposed framework encompasses several existing models of human-ML complementarity as special cases. Last but not least, the exploratory analysis of our framework offers a critical piece of insight for future work in this area: the mechanism by which we combine human-ML judgments should be informed by the underlying causes of their diverging decisions.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "44cabe32482d4b622d9ca00bf23b3ee7950e2710", "arXivId": "2204.10806", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10806.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Charvi Rastogi", "Liu Leqi", "Kenneth Holstein", "Hoda Heidari"]}
