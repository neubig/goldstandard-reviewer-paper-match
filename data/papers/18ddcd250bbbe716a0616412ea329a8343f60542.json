Proof of Theorem 4.1 We assume that there indeed exists some incentive-compatible payment function f , and prove a contradiction. Let us first consider the special case of N = G = 1 and B = 2. Since N = G = 1, there is only one question. Let p1 > 0.5 be the probability, according to the belief of the worker, that option 1 is correct; the worker then believes that option 2 is correct with probability (1 p1). When p1 = 1, we need the worker to select option 1 alone.
