{"title": "To ArXiv or not to ArXiv: A Study Quantifying Pros and Cons of Posting Preprints Online", "abstract": "Double-blind conferences have engaged in debates over whether to allow authors to post their papers online on arXiv or elsewhere during the review process. Independently, some authors of research papers face the dilemma of whether to put their papers on arXiv due to its pros and cons. We conduct a study to substantiate this debate and dilemma via quantitative measurements. Speci\ufb01cally, we conducted surveys of reviewers in two top-tier double-blind computer science conferences\u2014ICML 2021 (5361 submissions and 4699 reviewers) and EC 2021 (498 submissions and 190 reviewers). Our two main \ufb01ndings are as follows. First, more than a third of the reviewers self-report searching online for a paper they are assigned to review. Second, outside the review process, we \ufb01nd that preprints from better-ranked a\ufb03liations see a weakly higher visibility, with a correlation of 0.06 in ICML and 0.05 in EC. In particular, papers associated with the top-10-ranked a\ufb03liations had a visibility of approximately 11% in ICML and 22% in EC, whereas the remaining papers had a visibility of 7% and 18% respectively.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "fd0aa185be4e1f1fe3975779aec179348ec19ea8", "arXivId": "2203.17259", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.17259.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Charvi Rastogi", "Ivan Stelmakh", "Xinwei Shen", "M.
