{"title": "Very Fast Similarity Queries on Semi-Structured Data from the Web", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a single low-dimensional representation for entities found in different datasets on the web. Our proposed PIC-D embeddings can represent large D-partite graphs using small number of dimensions enabling fast similarity queries. Our experiments show that this representation can be constructed in small amount of time (linear in number of dimensions). We demonstrate how it can be used for variety of similarity queries like set expansion, automatic set instance acquisition, and column classification. Our approach results in comparable precision with respect to task specific baselines and up to two orders of magnitude improvement in terms of query response time.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "b82e9b84cb639f6bb061c8a43b97986ecfec00ea", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
