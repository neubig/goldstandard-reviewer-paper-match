{"title": "Cell planning for mobility management in heterogeneous cellular networks", "abstract": "In small cell networks, high mobility of users results in frequent handoff and thus severely restricts the data rate for mobile users. To alleviate this problem, we propose to use heterogeneous, two-tier network structure where static users are served by both macro and micro base stations, whereas the mobile (i.e., moving) users are served only by macro base stations having larger cells; the idea is to prevent frequent data outage for mobile users due to handoff. We use the classical two-tier Poisson network model with different transmit powers (cf [1]), assume independent Poisson process of static users and doubly stochastic Poisson process of mobile users moving at a constant speed along infinite straight lines generated by a Poisson line process. Using stochastic geometry, we calculate the average downlink data rate of the typical static and mobile (i.e., moving) users, the latter accounted for handoff outage periods. We consider also the average throughput of these two types of users defined as their average data rates divided by the mean total number of users co-served by the same base station. We find that if the density of a homogeneous network and/or the speed of mobile users is high, it is advantageous to let the mobile users connect only to some optimal fraction of BSs to reduce the frequency of handoffs during which the connection is not assured. If a heterogeneous structure of the network is allowed, one can further jointly optimize the mean throughput of mobile and static users by appropriately tuning the powers of micro and macro base stations subject to some aggregate power constraint ensuring unchanged mean data rates of static users via the network equivalence property (see [2]).", "year": 2016, "ssId": "4fd6488e38043d680c592170bf7f651c079d0e98", "arXivId": "1605.07341", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07341.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Arpan Chattopadhyay", "B.
