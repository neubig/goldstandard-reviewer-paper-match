{"title": "MUSEGAN : DEMONSTRATION OF A CONVOLUTIONAL GAN BASED MODEL FOR GENERATING MULTI-TRACK PIANO-ROLLS", "abstract": "Generating realistic and aesthetic pieces is one of the most exciting tasks in the field. We present in this demo paper a new neural music generation model we recently proposed, called MuseGAN. We exploit the potential of applying generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate multi-track pop/rock music of four bars, using convolutions in both the generators and the discriminators. Moreover, we propose an efficient approach for pre-processing symbolic data and share the data with the community. Our model can generate music either from scratch, or by following (accompanying) a track given by user.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "70bc4dc0bc72816773006c71b56fa5885c729caa", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Hao-Wen Dong", "Wen-Yi Hsiao", "Li-Chia Yang", "Yi-Hsuan Yang"]}
