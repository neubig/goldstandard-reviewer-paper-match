{"title": "Concave Pt\u2013Zn Nanocubes with High\u2010Index Faceted Pt Skin as Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Catalyst", "abstract": "High dosage of expensive Pt to catalyze the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode severely impedes the commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Therefore, it is urgent to cut down the Pt catalyst by efficiently improving the ORR activity while maintaining high durability. Herein, magic concave Pt\u2013Zn nanocubes with high\u2010index faceted Pt skin (Pt78Zn22) are proposed for high\u2010efficiency catalysis toward proton exchange membrane fuel cells. These unique structural features endow the Pt\u2010skin Pt78Zn22/KB with a mass activity of 1.18 mA \u03bcgPt\u20131 and a specific activity of 3.64 mA cm\u20132 for the ORR at 0.9 V (vs RHE). Meanwhile, the H2\u2013O2 fuel cell assembled by this catalyst delivers an ultrahigh peak power density of \u22481449 mW cm\u20132. Both experiments and theoretical calculations show that the electronic structure of the surface is adjusted, thereby shortening the length of the Pt\u2013Pt bond and reducing the adsorption energy of OH*/O* on the Pt surface. This work demonstrates the synergistic effect of the oxidation\u2010resistant metal Zn and the construction of Pt\u2010rich surface engineering. Also, it guides the future development of catalysts for their practical applications in energy conversion technologies and beyond.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "cc4cc594c7dd38482c46a2db440135b8f26ff54f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Mengli Liu", "Bang\u2010an Lu", "Gege Yang", "Pengfei Yuan", "Huicong Xia", "Yajin Wang", "Kaimin Guo", "Shuyan Zhao", "Jia Liu", "Yue Yu", "Wenfu Yan", "C.
