{"title": "An evaluation of EEG ocular artifact removal with a multi-channel wiener filter based on probabilistic generative model", "abstract": "Data contamination by ocular artifacts such as eye blinks and eye movements is a major barrier that must be overcome when attempting to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) data. To handle this problem, a number of artifact removal methods has been proposed. Specifically, we focus on a method using a multi-channel Wiener filters based on a probabilistic generative model. This method assumes that the observed signal is the sum of multiple signals elicited by psychological or physical events, and separates the observed signal into each event signal using estimated model parameters. Based on this scheme, we have proposed a model parameter estimation method using prior information of each event signal. In this paper, we examine the potential of this model to deal with highly contaminated signals by collecting EEG data intentionally contaminated by eye blinks and relatively clean ERP data, and using them as prior information of each event signal. We conducted an experimental evaluation using a classical attention task. The results showed the proposed method effectively enhances the target ERP component while reducing the contamination caused by eye blinks.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "634bbe75c34b82e664f1e9f083314b5bdb6ba187", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["H.
