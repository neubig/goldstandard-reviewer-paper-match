{"title": "Control Synthesis for High-Dimensional Systems With Counting Constraints", "abstract": "General purpose correct-by-construction synthesis methods are limited to systems with low dimensionality or simple specifications. In this work we consider highly symmetrical counting problems and exploit the symmetry to synthesize provably correct controllers for systems with tens of thousands of states. The key ingredients of the solution are an aggregate abstraction procedure for mildly heterogeneous systems and subsequent formulation of counting constraints as linear inequalities.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "fa774368fcf51cc0fa1bfda59b6a606e163c64b1", "arXivId": "1706.07863", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07863.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Petter Nilsson", "N.
