{"title": "The Hitachi-JHU DIHARD III System: Competitive End-to-End Neural Diarization and X-Vector Clustering Systems Combined by DOVER-Lap", "abstract": "This paper provides a detailed description of the Hitachi-JHU system that was submitted to the Third DIHARD Speech Diarization Challenge. The system outputs the ensemble results of the five subsystems: two x-vector-based subsystems, two end-to-end neural diarization-based subsystems, and one hybrid subsystem. We refine each system and all five subsystems become competitive and complementary. After the DOVER-Lap based system combination, it achieved diarization error rates of 11.58% and 14.09% in Track 1 full and core, and 16.94% and 20.01% in Track 2 full and core, respectively. With their results, we won second place in all the tasks of the challenge.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "7a737872a6693ba3f0c99651191b93dad0dadcee", "arXivId": "2102.01363", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01363.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Shota Horiguchi", "Nelson Yalta", "Paola Garc\u00eda", "Yuki Takashima", "Yawen Xue", "Desh Raj", "Zili Huang", "Yusuke Fujita", "Shinji Watanabe", "S.
