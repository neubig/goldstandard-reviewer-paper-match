{"title": "Sharp asymptotic and finite-sample rates of convergence of empirical measures in Wasserstein distance", "abstract": "The Wasserstein distance between two probability measures on a metric space is a measure of closeness with applications in statistics, probability, and machine learning. In this work, we consider the fundamental question of how quickly the empirical measure obtained from $n$ independent samples from $\\mu$ approaches $\\mu$ in the Wasserstein distance of any order. We prove sharp asymptotic and finite-sample results for this rate of convergence for general measures on general compact metric spaces. Our finite-sample results show the existence of multi-scale behavior, where measures can exhibit radically different rates of convergence as $n$ grows.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "1fc6290fa3e6784501ca67cbef33a6a8edcbdb9e", "arXivId": "1707.00087", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00087.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["J.
