{"title": "Unsupervised Semantic Frame Induction using Triclustering", "abstract": "We use dependency triples automatically extracted from a Web-scale corpus to perform unsupervised semantic frame induction. We cast the frame induction problem as a triclustering problem that is a generalization of clustering for triadic data. Our replicable benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed graph-based approach, Triframes, shows state-of-the art results on this task on a FrameNet-derived dataset and performing on par with competitive methods on a verb class clustering task.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "823956ee7b994735f3605f426a71e7f85d86f1d4", "arXivId": "1805.04715", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04715.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Dmitry Ustalov", "Alexander Panchenko", "A.
