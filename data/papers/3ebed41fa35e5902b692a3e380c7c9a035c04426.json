{"title": "Teaching AI Ethics Using Science Fiction", "abstract": "The cultural and political implications of modern AI research are not some far off concern, they are things that affect the world in the here and now. From advanced control systems with advanced visualizations and image processing techniques that drive the machines of the modern military to the slow creep of a mechanized workforce, ethical questions surround us. Part of dealing with these ethical questions is not just speculating on what could be but teaching our students how to engage with these ethical questions. We explore the use of science fiction as an appropriate tool to enable AI researchers to help engage students and the public on the current state and potential impacts of AI.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "3ebed41fa35e5902b692a3e380c7c9a035c04426", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Emanuelle Burton", "J.
