{"title": "Coordinating Narratives and the Capitol Riots on Parler", "abstract": "Coordinated disinformation campaigns are used to influence social media users, potentially leading to offline violence. In this study, we introduce a general methodology to uncover coordinated messaging through analysis of user parleys on Parler. The proposed method constructs a user-to-user coordination network graph induced by a user-totext graph and a text-to-text similarity graph. The text-to-text graph is constructed based on the textual similarity of Parler posts. We study three influential groups of users in the 6 January 2020 Capitol riots and detect networks of coordinated user clusters that are all posting similar textual content in support of different disinformation narratives related to the U.S. 2020 elections.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "d19e097f388ca12ff111989b2bac7d3cc3cf15ca", "arXivId": "2109.00945", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00945.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["L.
