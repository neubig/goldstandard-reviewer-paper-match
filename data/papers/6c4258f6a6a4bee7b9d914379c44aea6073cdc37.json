{"title": "Energy disaggregation via adaptive filtering", "abstract": "The energy disaggregation problem is recovering device level power consumption signals from the aggregate power consumption signal for a building. We show in this paper how the disaggregation problem can be reformulated as an adaptive filtering problem. This gives both a novel disaggregation algorithm and a better theoretical understanding for disaggregation. In particular, we show how the disaggregation problem can be solved online using a filter bank and discuss its optimality.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "6c4258f6a6a4bee7b9d914379c44aea6073cdc37", "arXivId": "1307.4132", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.4132.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Roy Dong", "L.
