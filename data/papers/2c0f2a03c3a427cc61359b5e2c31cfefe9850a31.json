{"title": "WebSets: extracting sets of entities from the web using unsupervised information extraction", "abstract": "We describe a open-domain information extraction method for extracting concept-instance pairs from an HTML corpus. Most earlier approaches to this problem rely on combining clusters of distributionally similar terms and concept-instance pairs obtained with Hearst patterns. In contrast, our method relies on a novel approach for clustering terms found in HTML tables, and then assigning concept names to these clusters using Hearst patterns. The method can be efficiently applied to a large corpus, and experimental results on several datasets show that our method can accurately extract large numbers of concept-instance pairs.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "2c0f2a03c3a427cc61359b5e2c31cfefe9850a31", "arXivId": "1307.0261", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.0261.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Bhavana Dalvi", "William W.
