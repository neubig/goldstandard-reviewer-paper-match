{"title": "Multi-nanocavities and Multi-defects Synergetic Enhancement for the Electromagnetic Absorption of the rGO-NG Film.", "abstract": "Dielectric loss is an important way to eliminate electromagnetic (EM) pollution. In order to achieve high dielectric loss, a graphene film (GF) reduced graphene oxide-N doped graphene (rGO-NG) was constructed from graphene oxide-Ni@polydopamine (GO-Ni@PDA) via the in-situ synthesis of hollow graphene spheres between graphene sheets. This in-situ was achieved by means of electrostatic self-assembly and metal-catalyzed crystallization. Owing to the synergetic effect of multi-nanocavities and multi-defects, the prepared rGO-NG film shows an average shielding effectiveness (SE) of 50.0 dB in the range of 8.2-12.4 GHz with a thickness of 12.2 \u03bcm, and the SE reflection (SER) is only 7.3 dB on average. It also exhibits an average dielectric loss tangent (tan \u03b4) of 23.1, which is 26 and 105 times higher than those of rGO and rGO-Ni, respectively. This work provides a simple but effective route to develop high performance graphene-based materials for application as an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding film in today's electronic devices.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "191169031c7646c02ecb1aaa9c8a6b6e05009730", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yue Yu", "Yifang Zhao", "Yongqiang Dai", "Yu Su", "Bing Liao", "Hao Pang"]}
