{"title": "Controllable Environment Protein Corona-Disguised Immunomagnetic Beads for High-Performance Circulating Tumor Cell Enrichment.", "abstract": "The enrichment performance of immunomagnetic beads (IMBs) in blood samples is usually challenging due to the ungoverned, in situ-formed protein corona, as it generally leads to negative effects, such as impeded targeting capacity and unwanted nonspecific absorption. On the contrary, a controlled protein premodification of IMBs with diverse functional environment (blood) proteins endows the composites with a new biological identity and may improve the anti-nonspecific ability, resulting in promising isolation benefits for circulating tumor cell (CTC) enrichment and downstream analyses. Specifically, fetal bovine serum and the four most abundant blood proteins, including human serum albumin, fibrinogen, immunoglobulin, and transferrin, were separately applied in this work. Conclusively, the biological properties of the applied protein corona camouflage have a great influence on the capture performance of IMBs, and certain proteins can enhance the enrichment performance to a large extent. Promisingly, human serum albumin-camouflaged IMBs (HSA-PIMBs) achieved a capture efficiency of 84.0-90.0% and significantly minimized nonspecific absorbed leukocytes to 164-264 in blood samples (0.5 mL, 25-55 model CTCs). Furthermore, HSA-PIMBs isolated 62-505 CTCs and 13-31 leukocytes from the blood samples of five cancer patients. The novel environment camouflage strategy provides a new insight into protein corona utilization and may improve the performance of targeted nanomaterials in a complex biological environment.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "7f588b1d2a5b199a19a4c3bad6bd5154c7355817", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Xiaoxi Zhou", "Yujia Zhang", "Ke Kang", "Yanchao Mao", "Yue Yu", "Qiangying Yi", "Yao Wu"]}
