{"title": "Crowdsourcing a Large Dataset of Domain-Specific Context-Sensitive Semantic Verb Relations", "abstract": "We present a new large dataset of 12403 context-sensitive verb relations manually annotated via crowdsourcing. These relations capture fine-grained semantic information between verb-centric propositions, such as temporal or entailment relations. We propose a novel semantic verb relation scheme and design a multi-step annotation approach for scaling-up the annotations using crowdsourcing. We employ several quality measures and report on agreement scores. The resulting dataset is available under a permissive CreativeCommons license at www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/data/verb-relations/. It represents a valuable resource for various applications, such as automatic information consolidation or automatic summarization.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "827e0def212f6834d615e4f3f25b55fe27f6460d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Maria Sukhareva", "Judith Eckle-Kohler", "Ivan Habernal", "Iryna Gurevych"]}
