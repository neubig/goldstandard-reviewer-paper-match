{"title": "Black box optimization for automatic speech recognition", "abstract": "State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are very complex, combining multiple techniques and involving many types of tuning parameters (e.g., numbers of states and Gaussians in HMMs, numbers of neurons/layers and learning rates in neural networks, etc.). To reach optimal performance in such systems, deep understanding and expertise of each component is necessary, thus limiting the development of ASR systems to skilled experts. To overcome the problem, this paper studies the use of black box optimization, which automatically tunes systems without any prior knowledge. We consider an ASR system as a function with tuning parameters as input and speech recognition performance (e.g., word accuracy) as output, and we investigate two probabilistic black box optimization techniques: Covariance Mean Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and Bayesian optimization using Gaussian process. Middle-vocabulary speech recognition experiments show the effectiveness of black box optimization, as performance approaching that of fine-tuned systems obtained by experts and/or outperforming that of sub-optimal systems can be automatically obtained.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "ce0fce520c639af010c71cc6adf57cdeb2790322", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Shinji Watanabe", "Jonathan Le Roux"]}
