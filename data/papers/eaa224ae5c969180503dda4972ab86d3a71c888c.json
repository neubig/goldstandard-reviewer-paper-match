{"title": "An Empirical Evaluation of End-to-End Polyphonic Optical Music Recognition", "abstract": "Previous work has shown that neural architectures are able to perform optical music recognition (OMR) on monophonic and homophonic music with high accuracy. However, piano and orchestral scores frequently exhibit polyphonic passages, which add a second dimension to the task. Monophonic and homophonic music can be described as homorhythmic, or having a single musical rhythm. Polyphonic music, on the other hand, can be seen as having multiple rhythmic sequences, or voices, concurrently. We first introduce a workflow for creating large-scale polyphonic datasets suitable for end-to-end recognition from sheet music publicly available on the MuseScore forum. We then propose two novel formulations for end-to-end polyphonic OMR\u2014one treating the problem as a type of multi-task binary classification, and the other treating it as multi-sequence detection. Building upon the encoderdecoder architecture and an image encoder proposed in past work on end-to-end OMR, we propose two novel decoder models\u2014FlagDecoder and RNNDecoder\u2014that correspond to the two formulations. Finally, we compare the empirical performance of these end-to-end approaches to polyphonic OMR and observe a new state-of-the-art performance with our multi-sequence detection decoder, RNNDecoder.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "eaa224ae5c969180503dda4972ab86d3a71c888c", "arXivId": "2108.01769", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01769.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Sachinda Edirisooriya", "Hao-Wen Dong", "Julian McAuley", "Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick"]}
