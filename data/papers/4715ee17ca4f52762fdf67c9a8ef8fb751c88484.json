{"title": "Blind Identification of ARX Models with Piecewise Constant Inputs", "abstract": "Blind system identification is known to be a hard ill-posed problem and without further assumptions, no unique solution is at hand. In this contribution, we are concerned with the task of identifying an ARX model from only output measurements. Driven by the task of identifying systems that are turned on and off at unknown times, we seek a piecewise constant input and a corresponding ARX model which approximates the measured outputs. We phrase this as a rank minimization problem and present a relaxed convex formulation to approximate its solution. The proposed method was developed to model power consumption of electrical appliances and is now a part of a bigger energy disaggregation framework. Code will be made available online.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "4715ee17ca4f52762fdf67c9a8ef8fb751c88484", "arXivId": "1303.6719", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.6719.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Henrik Ohlsson", "L.
