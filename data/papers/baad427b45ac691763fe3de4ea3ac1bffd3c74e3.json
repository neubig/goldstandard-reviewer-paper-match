{"title": "PartyTracker : Visualizing Changes in Party Affiliation over Time", "abstract": "Information visualization has become an increasingly important tool for political and social scientists in the age of \u201cbig data\u201d. In this paper, we present PartyTracker, a new visualization tool that allows users to analyze temporal and geographic party affiliation survey data from people with different demographic backgrounds. By switching between a \u201cmap\u201d view and a \u201ctime\u201d view, users can explore many different aspects of this large, multivariate dataset. We conducted usability testing and expert review to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool. The outcome of our work provides an interactive way to visualize historical changes in party affiliation. PartyTracker is capable of revealing insights about political survey data that are of interest to researchers studying partisanship as well as the general public.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "baad427b45ac691763fe3de4ea3ac1bffd3c74e3", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Souvik Bhattacherjee", "Yuwei Cui", "Mohit Iyyer"]}
