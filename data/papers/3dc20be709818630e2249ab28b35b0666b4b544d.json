{"title": "Analysis of Emphasis on Japanese-English Bilingual Corpora", "abstract": "Conventional speech-to-speech (S2S) translation [1] systems only translate the content of the utterance and ignore paralinguistic information included in the input speech. As a step towards addressing this limitation, in this paper we analyze paralinguistic information across languages. Among the various types of paralinguistic information, we focus on emphasis, a type of information that is used to convey the focus of the sentence. Emphasis is an important factor especially when repeating an initially misheard sentence (a situation that occurs often when using less-than perfect speech translation systems). This paper describes an analysis regarding how emphasis is expressed across two languages: Japanese and English.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "3dc20be709818630e2249ab28b35b0666b4b544d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["S.
