{"title": "Choosing How to Choose Papers", "abstract": "It is common to see a handful of reviewers reject a highly novel paper, because they view, say, extensive experiments as far more important than novelty, whereas the community as a whole would have embraced the paper. More generally, the disparate mapping of criteria scores to final recommendations by different reviewers is a major source of inconsistency in peer review. In this paper we present a framework --- based on $L(p,q)$-norm empirical risk minimization --- for learning the community's aggregate mapping. We draw on computational social choice to identify desirable values of $p$ and $q$; specifically, we characterize $p=q=1$ as the only choice that satisfies three natural axiomatic properties. Finally, we implement and apply our approach to reviews from IJCAI 2017.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "d0a58b6da9f7788534aa9963a78c24a87038e4fc", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ritesh Noothigattu", "Nihar B.
