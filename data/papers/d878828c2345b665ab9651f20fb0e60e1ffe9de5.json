{"title": "Observation of strains caused by heterostructure interfaces", "abstract": "By developing the sensitivity of our custom-made spectrometer, we have succeeded for the first time in detecting the strains in an Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs heterostructrued sample through Al nuclear spins based on standard nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. By analyzing the observed quadrupolar-split frequency value, it is concluded that the strain is dominantly caused by the lattice mismatch around the interface, rather than the contraction of epoxy resin that bundles the sample.
