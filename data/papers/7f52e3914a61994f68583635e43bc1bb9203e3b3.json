{"title": "Cytogenetic Consequences of Food Industry Workers Occupationally Exposed to Cooking Oil Fumes (COFs).", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCooking oil fumes (COFs) with smoking habits is a substantial risk that aggravates genetic modifications. The current study was to estimate the biological markers of genetic toxicity counting Micronucleus changes (MN), Chromosome Aberrations (CA) and DNA modifications among COFs exposures and control subjects inherent from South India.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPresent analysis comprised 212 COFs with tobacco users and equivalent number of control subjects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHigh frequency of CA (Chromatid type: and chromosome type) were identified in group II experimental subjects also high amount of MN and DNA damage frequency were significantly (p < 0.05) in both subjects (experimental smokers and non-smokers). Present analysis was observed absence of consciousness among the COFs exposures about the destructive level of health effects of tobacco habits in working environment.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCOFs exposed workers with tobacco induce the significant alteration in chromosomal level. Furthermore, a high level of rate of genetic diseases (spontaneous abortion) were identified in the experimental subjects. This finding will be helpful for preventive measures of COFs exposed workers and supportive for further molecular analysis.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "7f52e3914a61994f68583635e43bc1bb9203e3b3", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Manikantan Pappuswamy", "A.
