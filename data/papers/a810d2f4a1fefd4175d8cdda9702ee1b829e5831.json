{"title": "Phytohemagglutinin ameliorates HFD-induced obesity by increasing energy expenditure", "abstract": "Despite all modern advances in medicine, there are few reports of effective and safe drugs to treat obesity. Our objective was to screen anti-obesity natural compounds, and to verify whether they can reduce the body weight gain and investigate their molecular mechanisms. By using drug-screening methods, Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was found to be the most anti-obesity candidate natural compound. Six-week-old C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) and intraperitoneally injected with 0.25 mg/kg PHA everyday for 8 weeks. The body weight, glucose homeostasis, oxygen consumption and physical activity were assessed. We also measured the heat intensity, body temperature and the gene expression of key regulators of energy expenditure. Prevention study results showed PHA treatment not only reduced the body weight gain but also maintained glucose homeostasis in HFD-fed mice. Further study indicated energy expenditure and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) expression of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) in HFD-fed mice were significantly improved by PHA. In the therapeutic study, a similar effect was observed. PHA inhibited lipid droplet formation and upregulated mitochondrial-related gene expression during adipogenesis in vitro. UCP-1 KO mice displayed no differences in body weight, glucose homeostasis and core body temperature between PHA and control groups. Our results suggest that PHA prevent and treat obesity by increasing energy expenditure through upregulation of BAT thermogenesis.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "a810d2f4a1fefd4175d8cdda9702ee1b829e5831", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yunxia Zhang", "Jin Li", "Hui-hui Wang", "Jiao Li", "Yue Yu", "Bo Li", "Li Huang", "Chang-Jing Wu", "Xiaomeng Liu"]}
