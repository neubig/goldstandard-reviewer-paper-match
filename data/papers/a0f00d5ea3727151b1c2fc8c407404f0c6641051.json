{"title": "Ckylark: A More Robust PCFG-LA Parser", "abstract": "This paper describes Ckylark, a PCFG-LA style phrase structure parser that is more robust than other parsers in the genre. PCFG-LA parsers are known to achieve highly competitive performance, but sometimes the parsing process fails completely, and no parses can be generated. Ckylark introduces three new techniques that prevent possible causes for parsing failure: outputting intermediate results when coarse-to-fine analysis fails, smoothing lexicon probabilities, and scaling probabilities to avoid underflow. An experiment shows that this allows millions of sentences can be parsed without any failures, in contrast to other publicly available PCFG-LA parsers. Ckylark is implemented in C++, and is available opensource under the LGPL license.1", "year": 2015, "ssId": "a0f00d5ea3727151b1c2fc8c407404f0c6641051", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yusuke Oda", "Graham Neubig", "S.
