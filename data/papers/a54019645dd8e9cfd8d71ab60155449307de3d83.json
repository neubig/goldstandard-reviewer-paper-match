{"title": "Double or Nothing: Multiplicative Incentive Mechanisms for Crowdsourcing", "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has gained immense popularity in machine learning applications for obtaining large amounts of labeled data. Crowdsourcing is cheap and fast, but suffers from the problem of low-quality data. To address this fundamental challenge in crowdsourcing, we propose a simple payment mechanism to incentivize workers to answer only the questions that they are sure of and skip the rest. We show that surprisingly, under a mild and natural \"no-free-lunch\" requirement, this mechanism is the one and only incentive-compatible payment mechanism possible. We also show that among all possible incentive-compatible mechanisms (that may or may not satisfy no-free-lunch), our mechanism makes the smallest possible payment to spammers. Interestingly, this unique mechanism takes a \"multiplicative\" form. The simplicity of the mechanism is an added benefit. In preliminary experiments involving over several hundred workers, we observe a significant reduction in the error rates under our unique mechanism for the same or lower monetary expenditure.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "a54019645dd8e9cfd8d71ab60155449307de3d83", "arXivId": "1408.1387", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.1387.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Nihar B.
