{"title": "Lessons Learned from Creating a Course Advising Tool", "abstract": "We detail some lessons learned while designing and testing a course selection tool for undergraduates at a large state university. Between 2009\u20102011 we conducted two surveys of over 500 students in multiple majors and colleges. These surveys asked students detailed questions about their preferences concerning courses selection, advising, and career paths. We present data from this study which may be helpful for faculty and staff who advise undergraduate students. We find that advising software tools can help both students and human advisors in terms of rote requirement checking and basic course planning, but nothing can replace an in person advising session.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "ca6d5c7829a76d10069fa3aa6776c35cc044b7ba", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nicholas Mattei", "Thomas Dodson", "J.
