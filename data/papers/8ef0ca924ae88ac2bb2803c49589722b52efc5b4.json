{"title": "Construction and analysis of social-affective interaction corpus in English and Indonesian", "abstract": "Social-affective aspects of interaction play a vital role in making human communication a rich and dynamic experience. Observation of complex emotional phenomena requires rich sets of labeled data of natural interaction. Although there has been an increase of interest in constructing corpora containing social interactions, there is still a lack of spontaneous and emotionally rich corpora. This paper presents a corpus of social-affective interactions in English and Indonesian, constructed from various television talk shows, containing natural conversations and real emotion occurrences. We carefully annotate the corpus in terms of emotion and discourse structure to allow for the aforementioned observation. The corpus is still in its early stage of development, yielding wide-ranging possibilities for future work.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "8ef0ca924ae88ac2bb2803c49589722b52efc5b4", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nurul Lubis", "S.
