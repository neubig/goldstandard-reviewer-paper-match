{"title": "Automatic melody harmonization with triad chords: A comparative study", "abstract": "The task of automatic melody harmonization aims to build a model that generates a chord sequence as the harmonic accompaniment of a given multiple-bar melody sequence. In this paper, we present a comparative study evaluating the performance of canonical approaches to this task, including template matching, hidden Markov model, genetic algorithm and deep learning. The evaluation is conducted on a dataset of 9226 melody/chord pairs, considering 48 different triad chords. We report the result of an objective evaluation using six different metrics and a subjective study with 202 participants, showing that a deep learning method performs the best.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "3c40fc36217a56aafb0abc735ff7d132b17e83a0", "arXivId": "2001.02360", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02360.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yin-Cheng Yeh", "Wen-Yi Hsiao", "Satoru Fukayama", "Tetsuro Kitahara", "Benjamin Genchel", "Hao-Min Liu", "Hao-Wen Dong", "Yian Chen", "T.
