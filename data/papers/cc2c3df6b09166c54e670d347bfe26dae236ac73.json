{"title": "Multi-view Exploratory Learning for AKBC Problems", "abstract": "In this paper, we argue that many Automatic Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC) tasks which have previously been addressed separately can be viewed as instances of single abstract problem: multiview semi-supervised learning with an incomplete class hierarchy. We also present a general EM framework for solving this abstract task, and summarize past work on various special cases of multiview semi-supervised exploratory learning.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "cc2c3df6b09166c54e670d347bfe26dae236ac73", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Bhavana Dalvi", "William W.
