{"title": "Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Verb Clustering", "abstract": "In this work we apply Dirichlet Process Mixture Models to a learning task in natural language processing (NLP): lexical-semantic verb clustering. We assess the performance on a dataset based on Levin\u2019s (1993) verb classes using the recently introduced Vmeasure metric. In, we present a method to add human supervision to the model in order to to influence the solution with respect to some prior knowledge. The quantitative evaluation performed highlights the benefits of the chosen method compared to previously used clustering approaches.", "year": 2008, "ssId": "9abb50813e05de849dbbd89535bc7d0206f5e36a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andreas Vlachos", "Zoubin Ghahramani", "A.
