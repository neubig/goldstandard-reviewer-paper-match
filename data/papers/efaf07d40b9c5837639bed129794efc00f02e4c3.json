{"title": "Continuous N-gram Representations for Authorship Attribution", "abstract": "This paper presents work on using continuous representations for authorship attribution. In contrast to previous work, which uses discrete feature representations, our model learns continuous representations for n-gram features via a neural network jointly with the classification layer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on two datasets, while producing comparable results on the remaining two.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "efaf07d40b9c5837639bed129794efc00f02e4c3", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Mark Stevenson", "Andreas Vlachos", "Yunita Sari"]}
