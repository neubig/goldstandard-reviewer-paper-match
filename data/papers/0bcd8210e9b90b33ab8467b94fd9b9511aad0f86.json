{"title": "Performance Evaluation to Optimize the UMP System Focusing on Network Transmission Speed", "abstract": "With the great progress of technologies, computers are embedded into everywhere to make our daily life convenient, efficient and comfortable. Ubiquitous society became so real for us with this fast development. However, how to integrate distributed resources existed among heterogeneous devices to build pervasive applications that can constantly adapt to the highly dynamic computing environment is still a challenge. On our previous work, by analyzing the pipelining feature within a user task and exploiting the parallelism among ubiquitous processors, we proposed UMP-PerComp, a ubiquitous multiprocessor-based pipeline processing architecture to support high performance pervasive application development. In this research, we evaluated the network transmission speed of UMP system to reduce the network overhead and provided a method to design the best performance UMP system. Our experience revealed that the data size of transmission in UMP network plays an important rule which highly influence the performance of the whole UMP system.", "year": 2007, "ssId": "0bcd8210e9b90b33ab8467b94fd9b9511aad0f86", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["M.
