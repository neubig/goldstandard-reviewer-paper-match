{"title": "Search-based Neural Structured Learning for Sequential Question Answering", "abstract": "Recent work in semantic parsing for question answering has focused on long and complicated questions, many of which would seem unnatural if asked in a normal conversation between two humans. In an effort to explore a conversational QA setting, we present a more realistic task: answering sequences of simple but inter-related questions. We collect a dataset of 6,066 question sequences that inquire about semi-structured tables from Wikipedia, with 17,553 question-answer pairs in total. To solve this sequential question answering task, we propose a novel dynamic neural semantic parsing framework trained using a weakly supervised reward-guided search. Our model effectively leverages the sequential context to outperform state-of-the-art QA systems that are designed to answer highly complex questions.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "8ff54aa8045b1e30c348cf2ca42259c946cd7a9e", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Mohit Iyyer", "Wen-tau Yih", "Ming-Wei Chang"]}
