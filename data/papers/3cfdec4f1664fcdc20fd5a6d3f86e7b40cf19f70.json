{"title": "Controlling Output Length in Neural Encoder-Decoders", "abstract": "Neural encoder-decoder models have shown great success in many sequence generation tasks. However, previous work has not investigated situations in which we would like to control the length of encoder-decoder outputs. This capability is crucial for applications such as text summarization, in which we have to generate concise summaries with a desired length. In this paper, we propose methods for controlling the output sequence length for neural encoder-decoder models: two decoding-based methods and two learning-based methods. Results show that our learning-based methods have the capability to control length without degrading summary quality in a summarization task.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "3cfdec4f1664fcdc20fd5a6d3f86e7b40cf19f70", "arXivId": "1609.09552", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09552.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yuta Kikuchi", "Graham Neubig", "Ryohei Sasano", "Hiroya Takamura", "M.
