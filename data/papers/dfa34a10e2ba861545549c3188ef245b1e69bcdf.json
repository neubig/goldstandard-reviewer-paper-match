{"title": "Using word embedding for bio-event extraction", "abstract": "Bio-event extraction is an important phase towards the goal of extracting biological networks from the scientific literature. Recent advances in word embedding make computation of word distribution more ef- ficient and possible. In this study, we investigate methods bringing distributional characteristics of words in the text into event extraction by using the latest word embedding methods. By using bag-ofwords (BOW) features as the baseline, the result has been improved by the introduction of word-embedding features, and is comparable to the state-of-the-art solution.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "dfa34a10e2ba861545549c3188ef245b1e69bcdf", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Chen Li", "Runqing Song", "Maria Liakata", "Andreas Vlachos", "S.
