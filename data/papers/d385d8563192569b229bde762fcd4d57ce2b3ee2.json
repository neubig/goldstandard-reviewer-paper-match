{"title": "Learning to Define Terms in the Software Domain", "abstract": "One way to test a person\u2019s knowledge of a domain is to ask them to define domain-specific terms. Here, we investigate the task of automatically generating definitions of technical terms by reading text from the technical domain. Specifically, we learn definitions of software entities from a large corpus built from the user forum Stack Overflow. To model definitions, we train a language model and incorporate additional domain-specific information like word co-occurrence, and ontological category information. Our approach improves previous baselines by 2 BLEU points for the definition generation task. Our experiments also show the additional challenges associated with the task and the short-comings of language-model based architectures for definition generation.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "d385d8563192569b229bde762fcd4d57ce2b3ee2", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Vidhisha Balachandran", "Dheeraj Rajagopal", "R.
