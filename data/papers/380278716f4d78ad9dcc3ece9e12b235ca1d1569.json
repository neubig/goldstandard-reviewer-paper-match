{"title": "TensorLog: Deep Learning Meets Probabilistic DBs", "abstract": "We present an implementation of a probabilistic first-order logic called TensorLog, in which classes of logical queries are compiled into differentiable functions in a neural-network infrastructure such as Tensorflow or Theano. This leads to a close integration of probabilistic logical reasoning with deep-learning infrastructure: in particular, it enables high-performance deep learning frameworks to be used for tuning the parameters of a probabilistic logic. Experimental results show that TensorLog scales to problems involving hundreds of thousands of knowledge-base triples and tens of thousands of examples.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "380278716f4d78ad9dcc3ece9e12b235ca1d1569", "arXivId": "1707.05390", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05390.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["William W.
