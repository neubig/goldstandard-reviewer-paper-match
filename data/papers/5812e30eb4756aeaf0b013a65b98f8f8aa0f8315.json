{"title": "NTT-NAIST SMT systems for IWSLT 2013", "abstract": "This paper presents NTT-NAIST SMT systems for EnglishGerman and German-English MT tasks of the IWSLT 2013 evaluation campaign. The systems are based on generalized minimum Bayes risk system combination of three SMT systems: forest-to-string, hierarchical phrase-based, phrasebased with pre-ordering. Individual SMT systems include data selection for domain adaptation, rescoring using recurrent neural net language models, interpolated language models, and compound word splitting (only for German-English).", "year": 2013, "ssId": "5812e30eb4756aeaf0b013a65b98f8f8aa0f8315", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Katsuhito Sudoh", "Graham Neubig", "Kevin Duh", "Hajime Tsukada"]}
