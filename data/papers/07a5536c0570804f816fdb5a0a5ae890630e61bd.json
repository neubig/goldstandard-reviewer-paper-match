{"title": "A Hybrid Approach to Electrolaryngeal Speech Enhancement Based on Noise Reduction and Statistical Excitation Generation", "abstract": "SUMMARY This paper presents an electrolaryngeal (EL) speech enhancement method capable of significantly improving naturalness of EL speech while causing no degradation in its intelligibility. An electrolarynx is an external device that artificially generates excitation sounds to enable laryngectomees to produce EL speech. Although proficient laryngectomees can produce quite intelligible EL speech, it sounds very unnatural due to the mechanical excitation produced by the device. Moreover, the excitation sounds produced by the device often leak outside, adding to EL speech as noise. To address these issues, there are mainly two conventional approached to EL speech enhancement through either noise reduction or statistical voice conversion (VC). The former approach usually causes no degradation in intelligibility but yields only small improvements in naturalness as the mechanical excitation sounds remain essentially unchanged. On the other hand, the latter approach significantly improves naturalness of EL speech using spectral and excitation parameters of natural voices converted from acoustic parameters of EL speech, but it usually causes degradation in intelligibility owing to errors in conversion. We propose a hybrid approach using a noise reduction method for enhancing spectral parameters and statistical voice conversion method for predicting excitation parameters. Moreover, we further modify the prediction process of the excitation parameters to improve its prediction accuracy and reduce adverse effects caused by unvoiced/voiced prediction errors. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method yields significant improvements in naturalness compared with EL speech while keeping intelligibility high enough.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "07a5536c0570804f816fdb5a0a5ae890630e61bd", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kou Tanaka", "T.
