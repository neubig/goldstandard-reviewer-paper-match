{"title": "Opponent Anticipation via Conjectural Variations", "abstract": "We introduce a framework for multi-agent learning in which agents anticipate each others\u2019 reactions by forming conjectures about their learning processes, and devise learning rules using a variational perspective relative to these conjectures. The conjecture learning schemes lead to an alternative equilibrium concept, a differential general conjectural variations equilibrium. When compared to simultaneous gradient play, we empirically observe that implicit conjecture learning leads to a more equitable solution in a zero-sum polynomial game, while gradient and fast conjecture learning decrease the rotational components of the joint dynamics. The framework provides techniques for future synthesis of novel heterogeneous multi-agent learning rules.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "45f59bd3ef8e1d76474199c08c140675c04a728c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Benjamin J.
