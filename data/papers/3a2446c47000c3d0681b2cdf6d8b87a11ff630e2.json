{"title": "Research and Design of Installation Device for Building Exterior Wall Insulation Board", "abstract": "The study mainly solves the labor intensity of construction workers in the installation of engineering exterior wall insulation board installation engineers, poor installation quality, and high risk factor. The automatic mounting device for building exterior wall insulation boards is designed to use three-dimensional software SolidWorks to perform three-dimensional modeling, virtual assembly, and stress analysis. The feasibility of the device is verified and further constructs a physical prototype model. After manual analog construction processes, it is found to achieve the expected function. Finally, compare the artificial installation, the results show that the insulation board mounting device guarantees a better surface quality, and can shorten one-third of work, highly improved safety, stability, and high application value.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "3a2446c47000c3d0681b2cdf6d8b87a11ff630e2", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["PengCheng Wang", "Yue Yu", "Jinze Li", "ChangYu Ni", "Hong-liang Hu", "Xu Yang"]}
