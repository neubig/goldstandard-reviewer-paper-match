{"title": "When is Wall a Pared and when a Muro?: Extracting Rules Governing Lexical Selection", "abstract": "Learning fine-grained distinctions between vocabulary items is a key challenge in learning a new language. For example, the noun \u201cwall\u201d has different lexical manifestations in Spanish \u2013 \u201cpared\u201d refers to an indoor wall while \u201cmuro\u201d refers to an outside wall. However, this variety of lexical distinction may not be obvious to non-native learners unless the distinction is explained in such a way. In this work, we present a method for automatically identifying fine-grained lexical distinctions, and extracting rules explaining these distinctions in a human- and machine-readable format. We confirm the quality of these extracted rules in a language learning setup for two languages, Spanish and Greek, where we use the rules to teach non-native speakers when to translate a given ambiguous word into its different possible translations.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "d06493373421c86ba33dbb8834ccb725105a665f", "arXivId": "2109.06014", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06014.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Aditi Chaudhary", "Kayo Yin", "Antonios Anastasopoulos", "Graham Neubig"]}
