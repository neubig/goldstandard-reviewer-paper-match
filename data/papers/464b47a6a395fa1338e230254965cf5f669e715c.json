{"title": "Moses and the Character-Based Random Babbling Baseline: CoAStaL at AmericasNLP 2021 Shared Task", "abstract": "We evaluated a range of neural machine translation techniques developed specifically for low-resource scenarios. Unsuccessfully. In the end, we submitted two runs: (i) a standard phrase-based model, and (ii) a random babbling baseline using character trigrams. We found that it was surprisingly hard to beat (i), in spite of this model being, in theory, a bad fit for polysynthetic languages; and more interestingly, that (ii) was better than several of the submitted systems, highlighting how difficult low-resource machine translation for polysynthetic languages is.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "464b47a6a395fa1338e230254965cf5f669e715c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Marcel Bollmann", "Rahul Aralikatte", "H\u00e9ctor Murrieta Bello", "Daniel Hershcovich", "Miryam de Lhoneux", "Anders S\u00f8gaard"]}
