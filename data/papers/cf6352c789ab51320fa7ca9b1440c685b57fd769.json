{"title": "Diarization is Hard: Some Experiences and Lessons Learned for the JHU Team in the Inaugural DIHARD Challenge", "abstract": "We describe in this paper the experiences of the Johns Hopkins University team during the inaugural DIHARD diarization evaluation. This new task provided microphone recordings in a variety of difficult conditions and challenged researchers to fully consider all speaker activity, without the currently typical practices of unscored collars or ignored overlapping speaker segments. This paper explores several key aspects of currently state-of-the-art diarization methods, such as training data selection, signal bandwidth for feature extraction, representations of speech segments (i-vector versus x-vector), and domainadaptive processing. In the end, our best system clustered xvector embeddings trained on wideband microphone data followed by Variational-Bayesian refinement, and a speech activity detector specifically trained for this task with in-domain data was found to be the best performing. After presenting these decisions and their final result, we discuss lessons learned and remaining challenges within the lens of this new approach to diarization performance measurement.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "cf6352c789ab51320fa7ca9b1440c685b57fd769", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Gregory Sell", "David Snyder", "A.
