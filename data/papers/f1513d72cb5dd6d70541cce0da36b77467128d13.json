{"title": "NAIST at the CLEF 2013 QA4MRE Pilot Task", "abstract": "This paper describes the Nara Institute of Science and Tech- nology's system for the entrance exam pilot task of CLEF 2013 QA4MRE. The core of the system is a similar to the system for the main task of CLEF 2013 QA4MRE. We use minimum error rate training (MERT) to train the weights of the model and also propose a novel method for MERT with the addition of a threshold that denes the certainty with which we must answer questions. The system received a score of 22% c@1.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "f1513d72cb5dd6d70541cce0da36b77467128d13", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Philip Arthur", "Graham Neubig", "S.
