{"title": "Rule-based Syntactic Preprocessing for Syntax-based Machine Translation", "abstract": "Several preprocessing techniques using syntactic information and linguistically motivated rules have been proposed to improve the quality of phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) output. On the other hand, there has been little work on similar techniques in the context of other translation formalisms such as syntax-based SMT. In this paper, we examine whether the sort of rule-based syntactic preprocessing approaches that have proved beneficial for PBMT can contribute to syntax-based SMT. Specifically, we tailor a highly successful preprocessing method for EnglishJapanese PBMT to syntax-based SMT, andfind that while the gains achievable are smaller than those for PBMT, significant improvements in accuracy can be realized.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "b53689b8c28353106f327f0981b108eb67816053", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yuto Hatakoshi", "Graham Neubig", "S.
