{"title": "Experimental Investigations on the Influence Factors of Paperboard Deep Drawing", "abstract": "Experiments were conducted to study which type of paperboard and process parameters are suitable for deep drawing of paperboard into trays. The tray is a shallow rectangle box with round corners, wavy bottom and indented walls. Paperboard used in this paper is anisotropic, and its mechanical properties include tensile strength and elongation. Results show that paperboard with the basis weight of 260g/m2 is the suitable type. Proper moisture can improve the tensile strength and ensure the surface quality. Improper blank shape and size can result in wrinkling and cracking.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "3042bc348d6cc7959cd574756f720e5afad236de", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ya Jie Li", "Z.
