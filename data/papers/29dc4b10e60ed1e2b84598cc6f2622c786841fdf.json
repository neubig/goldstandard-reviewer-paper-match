{"title": "Control of Mobile Robots Using Barrier Functions Under Temporal Logic Specifications", "abstract": "In this article, we propose a framework for the control of mobile robots subject to temporal logic specifications using barrier functions. Complex task specifications can be conveniently encoded using linear temporal logic. In particular, we consider a fragment of linear temporal logic, which encompasses a large class of motion planning specifications for a robotic system. Control barrier functions have recently emerged as a convenient tool to guarantee reachability and safety for a system. In addition, they can be encoded as affine constraints in a quadratic program. In this article, a fully automatic framework that translates a user defined specification in temporal logic to a sequence of barrier function based quadratic programs is presented. In addition, with the aim of alleviating infeasibility scenarios, we propose methods for composition of barrier functions as well as a prioritization-based control method to guarantee feasibility of the controller. We prove that the resulting system trajectory synthesized by the proposed controller satisfies the given specification. Robotic simulation and experimental results are provided in addition to the theoretical framework.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "29dc4b10e60ed1e2b84598cc6f2622c786841fdf", "arXivId": "1908.04903", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04903.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Mohit Srinivasan", "S.
