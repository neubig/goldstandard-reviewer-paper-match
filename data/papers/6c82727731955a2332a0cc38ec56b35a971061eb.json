{"title": "XNMT: The eXtensible Neural Machine Translation Toolkit", "abstract": "This paper describes XNMT, the eXtensible Neural Machine Translation toolkit. XNMT distin- guishes itself from other open-source NMT toolkits by its focus on modular code design, with the purpose of enabling fast iteration in research and replicable, reliable results. In this paper we describe the design of XNMT and its experiment configuration system, and demonstrate its utility on the tasks of machine translation, speech recognition, and multi-tasked machine translation/parsing. XNMT is available open-source at this https URL", "year": 2018, "ssId": "6c82727731955a2332a0cc38ec56b35a971061eb", "arXivId": "1803.00188", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00188.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Graham Neubig", "Matthias Sperber", "Xinyi Wang", "Matthieu Felix", "Austin Matthews", "S.
