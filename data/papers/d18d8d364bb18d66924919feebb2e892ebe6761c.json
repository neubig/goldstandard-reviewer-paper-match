{"title": "Improving Neural Machine Translation through Phrase-based Forced Decoding", "abstract": "Compared to traditional statistical machine translation (SMT), neural machine translation (NMT) often sacrifices adequacy for the sake of fluency. We propose a method to combine the advantages of traditional SMT and NMT by exploiting an existing phrase-based SMT model to compute the phrase-based decoding cost for an NMT output and then using the phrase-based decoding cost to rerank the n-best NMT outputs. The main challenge in implementing this approach is that NMT outputs may not be in the search space of the standard phrase-based decoding algorithm, because the search space of phrase-based SMT is limited by the phrase-based translation rule table. We propose a soft forced decoding algorithm, which can always successfully find a decoding path for any NMT output. We show that using the forced decoding cost to rerank the NMT outputs can successfully improve translation quality on four different language pairs.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "d18d8d364bb18d66924919feebb2e892ebe6761c", "arXivId": "1711.00309", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00309.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Jingyi Zhang", "M.
