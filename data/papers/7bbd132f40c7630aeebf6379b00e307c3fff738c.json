{"title": "Explicit codes minimizing repair bandwidth for distributed storage", "abstract": "We consider the problem of minimizing the bandwidth required to repair a failed node when data is stored across n nodes in a distributed manner, so as to facilitate reconstruction of the entire data by connecting to any k out of the n nodes. We provide explicit and optimal constructions which permit exact replication of a failed systematic node.", "year": 2009, "ssId": "7bbd132f40c7630aeebf6379b00e307c3fff738c", "arXivId": "0908.2984", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.2984.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Nihar B.
