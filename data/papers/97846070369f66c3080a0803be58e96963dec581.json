{"title": "Clustering Analysis of Website Usage on Twitter During the COVID-19 Pandemic", "abstract": "In this study we analyzed patterns of external website usage on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a multi-view clustering technique, which is able to incorporate multiple views of the data, to cluster the websites\u2019 URLs based on their usage patterns and tweet text that occurs with the URLs. The results of the multi-view clustering of URLs used during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 29 January to 22 June 2020, revealed three, main clusters of URL usage. These three clusters differed significantly in terms of using information from different politically-biased, fake news, and conspiracy theory websites. Our results suggest that there are political biases in how information, to include misinformation, about the COVID-19 pandemic is used on Twitter. \u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "97846070369f66c3080a0803be58e96963dec581", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Iain J.
