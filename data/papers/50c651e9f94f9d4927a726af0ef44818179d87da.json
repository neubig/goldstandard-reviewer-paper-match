{"title": "Semantic Parsing as Machine Translation", "abstract": "Semantic parsing is the problem of deriving a structured meaning representation from a natural language utterance. Here we approach it as a straightforward machine translation task, and demonstrate that standard machine translation components can be adapted into a semantic parser. In experiments on the multilingual GeoQuery corpus we find that our parser is competitive with the state of the art, and in some cases achieves higher accuracy than recently proposed purpose-built systems. These results support the use of machine translation methods as an informative baseline in semantic parsing evaluations, and suggest that research in semantic parsing could benefit from advances in machine translation.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "50c651e9f94f9d4927a726af0ef44818179d87da", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Jacob Andreas", "Andreas Vlachos", "S.
