{"title": "Bayesian Models for Frequent Terms in Text", "abstract": "In this paper we present statistical models for text which treat words with higher frequencies of occurrence in a sensible manner, and perform better than widely used models based on the multinomial distribution on a wide range of classification tasks, with two or more classes. Our models are based on the Poisson and Negative-Binomial distributions, which keep desirable properties of simplicity and analytic tractability.", "year": 2004, "ssId": "1dfa71ecab0c25c5fdd6b2df83a41e944ffa5d58", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
