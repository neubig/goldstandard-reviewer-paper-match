{"title": "On the Way towards Standardized Semantic Corpora for Development of Semantic Analysis Systems", "abstract": "One of the main means to achieve progress in science is cooperation. It is advantageous if the cooperation is carried among teams at different institutions. In semantics, the basic necessity for cooperation is a standardized annotated corpus. Such a corpus allows to share individual findings by the whole research community because then different systems can be tested under the same conditions. Unfortunately there is no standardized semantic corpus for the Czech language and many other languages suffer the same. Moreover the ATIS corpus set is more than ten years old and it does not meet today\u2019s trends in semantic annotation. In this article we summarize the problems of the ATIS corpora set as well as the problems encountered during our research. As a result, we provide a methodology to avoid such problems. For practical deployment of the methodology we offer a set of annotation tools. The purpose of this article is to discuss the problematic of semantic annotation and to gather other teams to create standardized shared semantic corpora.
