{"title": "Guessing What's Plausible But Remembering What's True: Accurate Neural Reasoning for Question-Answering", "abstract": "Neural approaches to natural language processing (NLP) often fail at the logical reasoning needed for deeper language understanding. In particular, neural approaches to reasoning that rely on embedded generalizations of a knowledge base (KB) implicitly model which facts that are plausible, but may not model which facts are true, according to the KB. While generalizing the facts in a KB is useful for KB completion, the inability to distinguish between plausible inferences and logically entailed conclusions can be problematic in settings like as KB question answering (KBQA). We propose here a novel KB embedding scheme that supports generalization, but also allows accurate logical reasoning with a KB. Our approach introduces two new mechanisms for KB reasoning: neural retrieval over a set of embedded triples, and \u201cmemorization\u201d of highly specific information with a compact sketch structure. Experimentally, this leads to substantial improvements over the state-of-theart on two KBQA benchmarks.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "cd9e1eac4c93a314254cf8a8682ed5f01b6a808f", "arXivId": "2004.03658", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03658.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Haitian Sun", "Andrew O.
