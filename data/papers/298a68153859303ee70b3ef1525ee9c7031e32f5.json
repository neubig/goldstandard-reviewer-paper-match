{"title": "You Impress Me: Dialogue Generation via Mutual Persona Perception", "abstract": "Despite the continuing efforts to improve the engagingness and consistency of chit-chat dialogue systems, the majority of current work simply focus on mimicking human-like responses, leaving understudied the aspects of modeling understanding between interlocutors. The research in cognitive science, instead, suggests that understanding is an essential signal for a high-quality chit-chat conversation. Motivated by this, we propose P\u02c62 Bot, a transmitter-receiver based framework with the aim of explicitly modeling understanding. Specifically, P\u02c62 Bot incorporates mutual persona perception to enhance the quality of personalized dialogue generation. Experiments on a large public dataset, Persona-Chat, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a considerable boost over the state-of-the-art baselines across both automatic metrics and human evaluations.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "298a68153859303ee70b3ef1525ee9c7031e32f5", "arXivId": "2004.05388", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05388.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Qian Liu", "Yihong Chen", "B.
