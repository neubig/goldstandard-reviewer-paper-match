{"title": "A General and Scalable Approach to Mixed Membership Clustering", "abstract": "Spectral clustering methods are elegant and effective graph-based node clustering methods, but they do not allow mixed membership clustering. We describe an approach that first transforms the data from a node-centric representation to an edge-centric one, and then use this representation to define a scalable and competitive mixed membership alternative to spectral clustering methods. Experimental results show the proposed approach improves substantially in mixed membership clustering tasks over node clustering methods.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "029fa34b291c3f60b8a00cdf386e6048d45c394d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Frank Lin", "William W.
