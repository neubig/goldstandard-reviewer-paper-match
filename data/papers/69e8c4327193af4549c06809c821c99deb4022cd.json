{"title": "Explicit and optimal codes for distributed storage", "abstract": "In the distributed storage coding problem we consider, data is stored across n nodes in a network, each capable of storing \u03b1 symbols. It is required that the complete data can be reconstructed by downloading data from any k nodes. There is also the key additional requirement that a failed node be regenerated by connecting to any d nodes and downloading \u03b2 symbols from each of them. Our goal is to minimize the repair bandwidth d\u03b2. In this paper we provide explicit constructions for several parameter sets of interest.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "69e8c4327193af4549c06809c821c99deb4022cd", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["K.
