{"title": "Improving RNN Transducer with Target Speaker Extraction and Neural Uncertainty Estimation", "abstract": "Target-speaker speech recognition aims to recognize target-speaker speech from noisy environments with background noise and interfering speakers. This work presents a joint framework that combines time-domain target-speaker speech extraction and Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T). To stabilize the joint-training, we propose a multi-stage training strategy that pre-trains and fine-tunes each module in the system before joint-training. Meanwhile, speaker identity and speech enhancement uncertainty measures are proposed to compensate for residual noise and artifacts from the target speech extraction module. Compared to a recognizer fine-tuned with a target speech extraction model, our experiments show that adding the neural uncertainty module significantly reduces 17% relative Character Error Rate (CER) on multi-speaker signals with background noise. The multi-condition experiments indicate that our method can achieve 9% relative performance gain in the noisy condition while maintaining the performance in the clean condition.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "242c73ea34833910ad2643ec3a1096bb18c6d04d", "arXivId": "2011.13393", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13393.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Jiatong Shi", "Chunlei Zhang", "Chao Weng", "Shinji Watanabe", "Meng Yu", "Dong Yu"]}
