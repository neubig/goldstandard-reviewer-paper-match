{"title": "A proposal of the marriage of Encyclopedic and Commonsense Knowledge", "abstract": "Commonsense Knowledge (lexical + common knowledge) and Encyclopedic knowledge helps in different situations because one is about entities and other is about named entities. We set up a principled experiment to empirically verify that for real world scenarios, it is best to have a marriage of the types of knowledge. We envision WordNet to be the mediator between these two systems just like Wikipedia is the mediator in linked open data. For this purpose the Yago ontology would be helpful as well.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "41d4763792db8ea420efcfbd112a55deec971fee", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Dheeraj Rajagopal"]}
