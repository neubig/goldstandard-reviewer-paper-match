{"title": "Extended Graph Temporal Classification for Multi-Speaker End-to-End ASR", "abstract": "Graph-based temporal classification (GTC), a generalized form of the connectionist temporal classification loss, was recently proposed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using graph-based supervision. For example, GTC was first used to encode an N-best list of pseudo-label sequences into a graph for semi-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose an extension of GTC to model the posteriors of both labels and label transitions by a neural network, which can be applied to a wider range of tasks. As an example application, we use the extended GTC (GTC-e) for the multi-speaker speech recognition task. The transcriptions and speaker information of multi-speaker speech are represented by a graph , where the speaker information is associated with the transitions and ASR outputs with the nodes. Using GTC-e, multi-speaker ASR modelling becomes very similar to single-speaker ASR modeling, in that tokens by multiple speakers are recognized as a single merged sequence in chronological order. For evaluation, we perform experiments on a simulated multi-speaker speech dataset derived from LibriSpeech, obtaining promising results with performance close to classical benchmarks for the task.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "b9f0c7e99bcc94c2cd75fd8e1cef45188f51270e", "arXivId": "2203.00232", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00232.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Xuankai Chang", "Niko Moritz", "Takaaki Hori", "Shinji Watanabe", "Jonathan Le Roux"]}
