{"title": "Commonsense LocatedNear Relation Extraction", "abstract": "LocatedNear relation describes two typically co-located objects, which is a type of useful commonsense knowledge for computer vision, natural language understanding, machine comprehension, etc. We propose to automatically extract such relationship through a sentence-level classifier and aggregating the scores of entity pairs detected from a large number of sentences. To enable the research of these tasks, we release two benchmark datasets, one containing 5,000 sentences annotated with whether a mentioned entity pair has LocatedNear relation in the given sentence or not; the other containing 500 pairs of physical objects and whether they are commonly located nearby. We also propose some baseline methods for the tasks and compare the results with a state-of-the-art general-purpose relation classifier.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "19418493b1f9c82809fe4584af427b8807b8ae2d", "arXivId": "1711.04204", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.04204.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Frank F.
