{"title": "Answering Complicated Question Intents Expressed in Decomposed Question Sequences", "abstract": "Recent work in semantic parsing for question answering has focused on long and complicated questions, many of which would seem unnatural if asked in a normal conversation between two humans. In an effort to explore a conversational QA setting, we present a more realistic task: answering sequences of simple but inter-related questions. We collect a dataset of 6,066 question sequences that inquire about semi-structured tables from Wikipedia, with 17,553 question-answer pairs in total. Existing QA systems face two major problems when evaluated on our dataset: (1) handling questions that contain coreferences to previous questions or answers, and (2) matching words or phrases in a question to corresponding entries in the associated table. We conclude by proposing strategies to handle both of these issues.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "61ad8a0778598022e71c0ee3ba9bc53ddd616517", "arXivId": "1611.01242", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01242.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Mohit Iyyer", "Wen-tau Yih", "Ming-Wei Chang"]}
