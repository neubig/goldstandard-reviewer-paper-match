{"title": "5G Smart Grid Network Slice Backup Method Based on the Quality of Service", "abstract": "In the 5G mobile communication network virtualization scenario, how to deploy network slicing with high quality is a prerequisite for large-scale commercial use of 5G in the future. Cut for 5G networks. The quality of the chip deployment is based on the NFV backup configuration of the power business. In ultra-reliable and low-latency scenarios, high-quality VNF backup configurations in slices are realized. And on this basis, construct a mathematical model of network slicing deployment, which will benefit. Solve with a highly reliable backup algorithm based on reinforcement learning, and find the deployment plan with the lowest deployment cost of network slicing. Simulation experiments show that the deployment strategy is ensuring deployment security. Under the premise of reducing deployment costs, while obtaining better security benefits and deployment profitability.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "d5dcbb144a2be999610b4838d94cc3fb228f837c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Jiming Yao", "Yue Yu", "Xiaoxiao Chen", "Peng Zhou"]}
