{"title": "Creating an educational robot by embedding a learning agent in the physical world (abstract only)", "abstract": "One essential goal in education is to improve understanding of how humans acquire knowledge and how students vary in their abilities to learn. Building an intelligent agent that models student learning would be a significant achievement in the learning sciences. SimStudent is a state-of-the-art intelligent agent that simulates a human's learning process. However, SimStudent has only been living in the world of graphical user interfaces. To construct a more human-like learning agent, we integrate SimStudent with a cognitive robot, Calliope5KP, to create a physical agent that is able to learn skill knowledge by interacting with users in the physical world. We demonstrate the integration in a tic-tac-toe game, and show that the SimStudent robot is able to learn reasonably well with 12 games.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "68ea2572584068befd441dccf461f3444ff14f4a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nan Li", "Apoorv Khandelwal", "Tung Phan", "D.
