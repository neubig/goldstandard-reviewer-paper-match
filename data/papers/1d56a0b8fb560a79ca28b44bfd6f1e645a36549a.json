{"title": "Research and Application of Automatic Measurement of Resistance Value Based on a Thermal Control Device", "abstract": "The resistance measurement system of thermal control device is mainly composed of four parts: fixture, interface circuit board, switches module and data acquisition system. The main contents of the system design are as follows: To make the system realize the automatic resistance measurement function of thermocouple, heating belt and heating plate, and improves the measurement speed and robustness of the software; To achieve the friendliness of human-machine interface; At room temperature, it can collect 40 output voltage signals of thermocouple, and judge whether the temperature collection of thermocouple is accurate or not.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "1d56a0b8fb560a79ca28b44bfd6f1e645a36549a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Tao Feng", "Lei Huang", "M.
