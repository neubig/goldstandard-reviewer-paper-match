{"title": "Morphological Inflection Generation with Multi-space Variational Encoder-Decoders", "abstract": "This paper describes the CMU submission to shared task 1 of SIGMORPHON 2017. The system is based on the multi-space variational encoder-decoder (MSVED) method of Zhou and Neubig (2017), which employs both continuous and discrete latent variables for the variational encoder-decoder and is trained in a semi-supervised fashion. We discuss some language-specific errors and present result analysis.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "86b91922923b03c66497accfa88c638299fc8d26", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Chunting Zhou", "Graham Neubig"]}
