{"title": "Unsupervised Semantic Frame Induction using Triclustering : Supplementary Materials", "abstract": "We use dependency triples automatically extracted from a Web-scale corpus to perform unsupervised semantic frame induction. We cast the frame induction problem as a triclustering problem that is a generalization of clustering for triadic data. Our replicable benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed graph-based approach, Triframes, shows state-of-the art results on this task on a FrameNet-derived dataset and performing on par with competitive methods on a verb class clustering task. This document contains supplementary materials to the main paper. 1 Triple Vector Representation Figure 1 illustrates our approach for triple vector representation. In our representation, given a syntactic subject-verb-object (SVO) triple (people,make,money), we concatenate the word embeddings corresponding to these words into a single vector representing the whole triple. This explains the core assumption underlying in the Triframes approach: triples representing similar roles appear in similar contexts. 2 Implementation Details We use a parallel implementation of the WATSET1 algorithm in Java for graph clustering, the Gensim2 library for handling word embeddings, and the Faiss3 library for indexing of word emhttps://github.com/dustalov/ watset-java https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/ https://github.com/facebookresearch/ faiss Figure 1: Concatenation of the vectors corresponding to the SVO triple elements expresses structural similarity of the triples.

Note that the Singletons baseline produced a distinct cluster for each triple and yet received low scores on each scale. https://github.com/uhh-lt/triframes 4 Examples of Induced Frames Figures 2, 3 and 4 demonstrate examples of \u201cgood\u201d frames, i.e. those which are semantically plausible according to our human judgment during a post-hoc manual analysis of clustering results. Figures 5, 6 and 7 show examples of \u201cbad\u201d frames according to the same criteria. All the frames are produced by the Triframes WATSET method ranked best as according to the Frame F1 in the frame induction experiment. In particular, the number of nearest neighbors is n = 30, and the WATSET[CWtop, CWtop] fuzzy clustering algorithm has been used. These frames are available in the file triw2v-watset-n30-top-top-triples.txt available in the \u201cDownloads\u201d section of our GitHub repository (cf. Section 2).
