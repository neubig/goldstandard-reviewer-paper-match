{"title": "Summarising Historical Text in Modern Languages", "abstract": "We introduce the task of historical text summarisation, where documents in historical forms of a language are summarised in the corresponding modern language. This is a fundamentally important routine to historians and digital humanities researchers but has never been automated. We compile a high-quality gold-standard text summarisation dataset, which consists of historical German and Chinese news from hundreds of years ago summarised in modern German or Chinese. Based on cross-lingual transfer learning techniques, we propose a summarisation model that can be trained even with no cross-lingual (historical to modern) parallel data, and further benchmark it against state-of-the-art algorithms. We report automatic and human evaluations that distinguish the historic to modern language summarisation task from standard cross-lingual summarisation (i.e., modern to modern language), highlight the distinctness and value of our dataset, and demonstrate that our transfer learning approach outperforms standard cross-lingual benchmarks on this task.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "d8d12c922fc571d081bae27c67fcf50cdbb17d90", "arXivId": "2101.10759", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10759.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Xutan Peng", "Yifei Zheng", "Chenghua Lin", "Advaith Siddharthan"]}
