{"title": "Modified laser-assisted lip repositioning surgery to treat gummy smile", "abstract": "Excessive gingival display (EGD), known as \u201cgummy smile,\u201d is a major esthetic hurdle in today's population. The condition occurs due to various etiologies such as skeletal, dentoalveolar, or soft-tissue origin. The treatment modalities range from orthognathic surgery to periodontal plastic procedures. Lip-repositioning surgery (LRS) is a better alternative for the conventional orthognathic surgery and laser-assisted LRS can be a reliable and a less invasive alternative to conventional (scalpel) LRS. The present case describes the successful treatment of a young female exhibiting an EGD caused by hypermobility of the upper lip and was treated with a modified laser-assisted LRS coupled with gingival recontouring. In a study published earlier, a mild recurrence was observed and hence, to overcome the recurrence, a modified technique, by excising a strip of mucosa with an additional 2 mm of tissue along with the muscular attachment rather than scraping, was attempted.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "222ae836430ad0c922b47a9345c17212f9584097", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Sana Farista", "Aditi Chaudhary", "B.
