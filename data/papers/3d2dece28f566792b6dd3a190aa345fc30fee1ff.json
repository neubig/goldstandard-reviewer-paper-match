{"title": "Vertiport Selection in Hybrid Air-Ground Transportation Networks via Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints", "abstract": "Urban Air Mobility is a concept that promotes aerial modes of transport in urban areas. In these areas, the location and capacity of the vertiports\u2013where the travelers embark and disembark the aircraft\u2013not only affect the flight delays of the aircraft, but can also aggravate the congestion of ground vehicles by creating extra ground travel demands. We introduce a mathematical model for selecting the vertiports location and capacity that minimizes the traffic congestion in hybrid air-ground transportation networks. Our model is based on a mathematical program with bilinear equilibrium constraints. Furthermore, we show how to compute a global optimal solution of this mathematical program by solving a mixed integer linear program. We demonstrate our results via the Anaheim transportation network model, which contains more than 400 nodes and 900 links.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "3d2dece28f566792b6dd3a190aa345fc30fee1ff", "arXivId": "2203.05702", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05702.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yue Yu", "Mengyuan Wang", "M.
