{"title": "Multiple Objective Preform Die Shape Optimization Design for Controlling Forging\u2019s Shape and Deforming Force during Forging Process", "abstract": "In order to decrease the cost of the material and energy during the forging process, multiple preform die shape optimization design was carried out in this paper. Based on the FEM, a sensitivity analysis method was used to perform the optimization procedure. The shape of the forging and deforming force of the final forging was used to express the cost of material and energy respectively. Using the weighted sum method, the total objective function was gotton. The coordinates of the control point of the B-spline used to represent the preform die shape was determined as the optimization design variable. The sensitivity equations of the total objective function with respect to the design variables was developed. The multiple objective perform design optimization software was developed by FORTRAN language. And then, the preform die shape of an H-shaped forging process is optimized. The total objective function, sub-objective function, the shape of the preform die and the final forging during the optimization were given. After the optimiztion, a near net shape forging was obtained. At the same time, the deforming force decreased. The optimization results are very satisfactory.", "year": 2011, "ssId": "4eb22b488052c430170139c492674aa05512f7bf", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Xin Hai Zhao", "Guoqun Zhao", "X.
