{"title": "Toolkits for Robust Speech Processing", "abstract": "Recent robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques have been developed rapidly due to the demand placed on ASR applications in real environments, with the help of publicly available tools developed in the community. This chapter overviews major toolkits available for robust ASR, covering general ASR toolkits, language model toolkits, speech enhancement/microphone array front-end toolkits, deep learning toolkits, and emergent end-to-end ASR toolkits. The aim of this chapter is to provide information about functionalities (features, functions, platform, and language), license, and source location so that readers can easily access such tools to build their own robust ASR systems. Some of the toolkits have actually been used to build state-of-the-art ASR systems for various challenging tasks. The references in this chapter also includes the URLs of the resource webpages.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "5547eff5376c56358be56f8bcc3a4b6ce4600bb5", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Shinji Watanabe", "Takaaki Hori", "Y.
