{"title": "Applying Probability Measures to Abstract Languages", "abstract": "The problem of assigning a probability to each word of a language is considered. Two methods are discussed. One method assigns a probability to a word on the basis of particular measurable features of the language. The second method is applied to languages L(G) generated by a grammar G. A probability is associated with each production of G. These in turn define the word probabilities of each word in the language. The conditions for this assignment to be a probabilistic measure are derived.", "year": 1973, "ssId": "c9d7b1f9b13d6ea4ff45b908285cc65af959cc5b", "arXivId": null, "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1672339", "openAccess": false, "authors": ["T.
