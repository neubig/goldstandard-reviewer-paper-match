{"title": "A Summary of the First Workshop on Language Technology for Language Documentation and Revitalization", "abstract": "Despite recent advances in natural language processing and other language technology, the application of such technology to language documentation and conservation has been limited. In August 2019, a workshop was held at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, USA to attempt to bring together language community members, documentary linguists, and technologists to discuss how to bridge this gap and create prototypes of novel and practical language revitalization technologies. The workshop focused on developing technologies to aid language documentation and revitalization in four areas: 1) spoken language (speech transcription, phone to orthography decoding, text-to-speech and text-speech forced alignment), 2) dictionary extraction and management, 3) search tools for corpora, and 4) social media (language learning bots and social media analysis). This paper reports the results of this workshop, including issues discussed, and various conceived and implemented technologies for nine languages: Arapaho, Cayuga, Inuktitut, Irish Gaelic, Kidaw\u2019ida, Kwak\u2019wala, Ojibwe, San Juan Quiahije Chatino, and Seneca.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "42605c1ee030721cb38a3c225992d63297a6ace0", "arXivId": "2004.13203", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13203.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Graham Neubig", "Shruti Rijhwani", "Alexis Palmer", "Jordan MacKenzie", "Hilaria Cruz", "Xinjian Li", "Matthew Russell Lee", "Aditi Chaudhary", "Luke Gessler", "Steven P.
