{"title": "C2DN: How to Harness Erasure Codes at the Edge for Ef\ufb01cient Content Delivery", "abstract": "Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) deliver much of the world\u2019s web and video content to users from thousands of clusters deployed at the \u201cedges\u201d of the Internet. Maintain-ing consistent performance in this large distributed system is challenging. Through analysis of month-long logs from over 2000 clusters of a large CDN, we study the patterns of server unavailability. For a CDN with no redundancy, each server unavailability causes a sudden loss in performance as the objects previously cached on that server are not accessible, which leads to a miss ratio spike. The state-of-the-art mitigation technique used by large CDNs is to replicate objects across multiple servers within a cluster. We \ufb01nd that although replication reduces miss ratio spikes, spikes remain a performance challenge. We present C2DN, the \ufb01rst CDN design that achieves a lower miss ratio, higher availability, higher resource ef\ufb01ciency, and close-to-perfect write load balancing. The core of our design is to introduce erasure coding into the CDN architecture and use the parity chunks to re-balance the write load across servers. We implement C2DN on top of open-source production software and demonstrate that compared to replication-based CDNs, C2DN obtains 11% lower byte miss ratio, eliminates unavailability-induced miss ratio spikes, and reduces write load imbalance by 99%.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "d34712c217046ccf8063efe083fbb1e6cbfc0340", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Juncheng Yang", "A.
