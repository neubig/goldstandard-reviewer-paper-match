{"title": "Learning to Identify the Best Contexts for Knowledge-based WSD", "abstract": "We outline a learning framework that aims at identifying useful contextual cues for knowledge-based word sense disambiguation. The usefulness of individual context words is evaluated based on diverse lexico-statistical and syntactic information, as well as simple word distance. Experiments using two different knowledge-based methods and benchmark datasets show significant improvements due to context modeling, beating the conventional window-based approach.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "13d9d24ff2ba69de4cedcebd8f59371a5c1de7ed", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Evgenia Wasserman Pritsker", "William W.
