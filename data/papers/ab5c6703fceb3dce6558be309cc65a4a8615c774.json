{"title": "Accurate and Fast Retrieval for Complex Non-metric Data via Neighborhood Graphs", "abstract": "We demonstrate that a graph-based search algorithm\u2014relying on the construction of an approximate neighborhood graph\u2014can directly work with challenging non-metric and/or non-symmetric distances without resorting to metric-space mapping and/or distance symmetrization, which, in turn, lead to substantial performance degradation. Although the straightforward metrization and symmetrization is usually ineffective, we find that constructing an index using a modified, e.g., symmetrized, distance can improve performance. This observation paves a way to a new line of research of designing index-specific graph-construction distance functions.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "ab5c6703fceb3dce6558be309cc65a4a8615c774", "arXivId": "1910.03534", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.03534.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Leonid Boytsov", "Eric Nyberg"]}
