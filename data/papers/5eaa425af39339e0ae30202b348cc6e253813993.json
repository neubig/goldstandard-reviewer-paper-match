{"title": "An information retrieval system for technology analysis and forecasting", "abstract": "Expert evaluation of grant proposals and research projects is often facilitated by specialized decision support systems, which analyze research and industry trends in a large domain-dependent text corpus. Despite that there exist production-grade technological forecasting systems for English, Russian patent databases and citation indexes had been developed isolated from the global ones. This complicates technology analysis and forecasting in research conducted in Russia. In this paper, we present a scientific information retrieval system designed for the Russian language. The system uses patents, research papers and government contracts for facilitating the expertise process by providing the experts with relevant documents. Comparison of our system with a popular baseline shows promising results.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "5eaa425af39339e0ae30202b348cc6e253813993", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["N.
