{"title": "ACM SIGAI activity report", "abstract": "We are happy to present the annual activity report of ACM SIGAI, covering the period from July 2017 to June 2018.\n The scope of ACM SIGAI consists of the study of intelligence and its realization in computer systems (see also our website at sigai.acm.org). This includes areas such as\n autonomous agents, cognitive modeling, computer vision, constraint programming, human language technologies, intelligent user interfaces, knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, planning and search, problem solving, and robotics.\n Our members come from academia, industry, and government agencies worldwide. We are thrilled to be able to report that our membership numbers increased by about 10 percent over the past year!\n The terms of three of our officers (one of the two education activities officers, one of the two newsletter co-editors in chief, and the information officer) came to an end. We thank them for their valuable service and have now started to provide certificates of appreciation for outgoing officers. We appointed a new information officer and are currently looking for a new newsletter co-editor in chief and additional column editors. We also created and filled two new officer positions to be able to serve our members even better, namely an AI and society officer and a labor market officer.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "e95a96dec775cc792b763f4eec13343c22e850e1", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Sven Koenig", "Sanmay Das", "Rosemary D.
