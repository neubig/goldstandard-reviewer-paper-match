{"title": "A Dialog System with Human-to-Human Conversation Example", "abstract": "Example-based dialog modeling (EBDM) is datadriven approach for deploying dialog systems [1, 2]. Some studies propose constructing dialog examples from available human-to human conversation log databases [3, 4] or movie scripts [5]. However, these works did not filter any uncorrelated consecutive lines in the movie data. As the authors state, this causes failures and diminishes the ability to maintain a consistent conversation. In this paper, we summarize our work on a dialog agent that utilizes human-to-human conversation examples from movies and Twitter to reduce the time requirement for database design and collection, and allow the agent to interact with the user in as natural as fashion as possible. Next, we investigate various data-driven approaches to dialog management, including two EBDM techniques (syntactic-semantic similarity retrieval and TF-IDF based cosine similarity retrieval) and using statistical machine translation (SMT) to learn a conversational mapping between user-input and systemoutput dialog pairs.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "0a4dd1e51616b422aa2d437610dbfbdd3733a114", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Lasguido Nio", "S.
