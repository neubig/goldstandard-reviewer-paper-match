{"title": "Which Evaluations Uncover Sense Representations that Actually Make Sense?", "abstract": "Text representations are critical for modern natural language processing. One form of text representation, sense-specific embeddings, reflect a word\u2019s sense in a sentence better than single-prototype word embeddings tied to each type. However, existing sense representations are not uniformly better: although they work well for computer-centric evaluations, they fail for human-centric tasks like inspecting a language\u2019s sense inventory. To expose this discrepancy, we propose a new coherence evaluation for sense embeddings. We also describe a minimal model (Gumbel Attention for Sense Induction) optimized for discovering interpretable sense representations that are more coherent than existing sense embeddings.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "ecc520794da34d2b141235002c70b06c999bda73", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Jordan L.
