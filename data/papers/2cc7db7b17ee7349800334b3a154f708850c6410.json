{"title": "The MDS Queue: Analysing the Latency Performance of Erasure Codes", "abstract": "In order to scale economically, data centers are increasingly evolving their data storage methods from simple data replication to more powerful erasure codes, which provide the same level of reliability as replication, but at a significantly lower storage cost. In particular, it is well known that maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes, such as Reed\u2013Solomon codes, can achieve a target reliability with the maximum storage efficiency. While the use of codes for providing improved reliability in archival storage systems, where data is less frequently accessed (or so-called \u201ccold data\u201d), is well understood, the role of codes in storing more frequently accessed and active \u201chot data\u201d, where latency is the key metric, is less clear. In this paper, we study data storage systems based on MDS codes through the lens of queueing theory, and term the queueing system arising under codes as an \u201cMDS queue.\u201d We provide lower and upper bounds on the average job latency for both centralized and decentralized versions of MDS queues. We also provide extensive simulations to corroborate our analysis as well as obtain additional insights.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "2cc7db7b17ee7349800334b3a154f708850c6410", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kangwook Lee", "Nihar B.
