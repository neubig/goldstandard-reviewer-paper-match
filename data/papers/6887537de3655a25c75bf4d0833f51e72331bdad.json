{"title": "A method for converting a noisy signal in an extended audio signal", "abstract": "A process converts a noisy audio signal into an enhanced audio signal by first detecting the noisy audio signal from an environment around. The noisy audio signal, we processed by an extension network with network parameters to produce a common size mask and a phase estimate. Then the size of the mask and the phase estimate is used to obtain the extended audio signal.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "6887537de3655a25c75bf4d0833f51e72331bdad", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["J.
