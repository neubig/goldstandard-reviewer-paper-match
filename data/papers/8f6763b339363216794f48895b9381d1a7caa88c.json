{"title": "Disturbance Decoupling for Gradient-Based Multi-Agent Learning With Quadratic Costs", "abstract": "Motivated by applications of multi-agent learning in noisy environments, this letter studies the robustness of gradient-based learning dynamics with respect to disturbances. While disturbances injected along a coordinate corresponding to any individual player\u2019s actions can always affect the overall learning dynamics, a subset of players can be disturbance decoupled\u2014i.e., such players\u2019 actions are completely unaffected by the injected disturbance. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee this property for games with quadratic cost functions, which encompass quadratic one-shot continuous games, finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) dynamic games, and bilinear games. Specifically, disturbance decoupling is characterized by both algebraic and graph-theoretic conditions on the learning dynamics, the latter is obtained by constructing a game graph based on gradients of players\u2019 costs. For LQ games, we show that disturbance decoupling imposes constraints on the controllable and unobservable subspaces of players. For two player bilinear games, we show that disturbance decoupling within a player\u2019s action coordinates imposes constraints on the payoff matrices. Illustrative numerical examples are provided.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "8f6763b339363216794f48895b9381d1a7caa88c", "arXivId": "2007.07228", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07228.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Sarah H.
