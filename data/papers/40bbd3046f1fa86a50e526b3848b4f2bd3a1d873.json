{"title": "Soluble and Perfluorinated Polyelectrolyte for Safe and High-Performance Li-O2 Batteries.", "abstract": "The severe performance degradation of high-capacity Li-O2 batteries induced by Li dendrite growth and concentration polarization from the low Li+ transfer number of conventional electrolytes hinder their practical applications. Herein, lithiated Nafion (LN) with the sulfonic group immobilized on the perfluorinated backbone has been designed as a soluble lithium salt for preparing a less flammable polyelectrolyte solution, which not only simultaneously achieves a high Li+ transfer number (0.84) and conductivity (2.5\u2005mS\u2009cm-1 ), but also the perfluorinated anion of LN produces a LiF-rich SEI for protecting the Li anode from dendrite growth. Thus, the Li-O2 battery with a LN-based electrolyte achieves an all-round performance improvement, like low charge overpotential (0.18\u2005V), large discharge capacity (9508\u2005mAh\u2009g-1 ), and excellent cycling performance (225\u2005cycles). Besides, the fabricated pouch-type Li-air cells exhibit promising applications to power electronic equipment with satisfactory safety.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "40bbd3046f1fa86a50e526b3848b4f2bd3a1d873", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Qilong Xiong", "Gang Huang", "Yue Yu", "Chaojuan Li", "Jianchen Li", "Jun-min Yan", "Xin-bo Zhang"]}
