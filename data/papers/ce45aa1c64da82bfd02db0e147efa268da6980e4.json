{"title": "Analysis of Bit Loading Algorithms in OFDM System", "abstract": "How to allocate the numbers of transmitted bits to the sub carriers in OFDM system is studied in this article. Among all the bit loading algorithms, three classic bit loading algorithms are investigated, the Greedy algorithm is mostly analyzed, the performance of the three algorithms are also analyzed by simulation and some improved methods are proposed", "year": 2012, "ssId": "ce45aa1c64da82bfd02db0e147efa268da6980e4", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yue Yu", "Hua Yuan", "Feng Yong Fan"]}
