{"title": "HHMM at SemEval-2019 Task 2: Unsupervised Frame Induction using Contextualized Word Embeddings", "abstract": "We present our system for semantic frame induction that showed the best performance in Subtask B.1 and finished as the runner-up in Subtask A of the SemEval 2019 Task 2 on unsupervised semantic frame induction (Qasem-iZadeh et al., 2019). Our approach separates this task into two independent steps: verb clustering using word and their context embeddings and role labeling by combining these embeddings with syntactical features. A simple combination of these steps shows very competitive results and can be extended to process other datasets and languages.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "5b1bb1f6ed091dfd53adf7ebbcda2c48a3b67c2c", "arXivId": "1905.01739", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01739.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["S.
