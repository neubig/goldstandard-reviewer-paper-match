{"title": "IMDB-WIKI-SbS: An Evaluation Dataset for Crowdsourced Pairwise Comparisons", "abstract": "Today, comprehensive evaluation of large-scale machine learning models is possible thanks to the open datasets produced using crowdsourcing, such as SQuAD, MS COCO, ImageNet, SuperGLUE, etc. These datasets capture objective responses, assuming the single correct answer, which does not allow to capture the subjective human perception. In turn, pairwise comparison tasks, in which one has to choose between only two options, allow taking peoples\u2019 preferences into account for very challenging artificial intelligence tasks, such as information retrieval and recommender system evaluation. Unfortunately, the available datasets are either small or proprietary, slowing down progress in gathering better feedback from human users. In this paper, we present IMDB-WIKI-SbS, a new large-scale dataset for evaluating pairwise comparisons.1 It contains 9,150 images appearing in 250,249 pairs annotated on a crowdsourcing platform. Our dataset has balanced distributions of age and gender using the well-known IMDB-WIKI dataset as ground truth. We describe how our dataset is built and then compare several baseline methods, indicating its suitability for model evaluation.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "60e339d25d43c026cf96395aa8accf34eae744a5", "arXivId": "2110.14990", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14990.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Nikita Pavlichenko", "Dmitry Ustalov"]}
