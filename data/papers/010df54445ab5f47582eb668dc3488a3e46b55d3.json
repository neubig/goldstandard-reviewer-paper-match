{"title": "Unsupervised Neural Hidden Markov Models", "abstract": "In this work, we present the first results for neuralizing an Unsupervised Hidden Markov Model. We evaluate our approach on tag in- duction. Our approach outperforms existing generative models and is competitive with the state-of-the-art though with a simpler model easily extended to include additional context.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "010df54445ab5f47582eb668dc3488a3e46b55d3", "arXivId": "1609.09007", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09007.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Ke M.
