{"title": "Toward Streaming ASR with Non-Autoregressive Insertion-Based Model", "abstract": "Neural end-to-end (E2E) models have become a promising technique to realize practical automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. When realizing such a system, one important issue is the segmentation of audio to deal with streaming input or long recording. After audio segmentation, the ASR model with a small real-time factor (RTF) is preferable because the latency of the system can be faster. Recently, E2E ASR based on non-autoregressive models becomes a promising approach since it can decode an N -length token sequence with less than N iterations. We propose a system to concatenate audio segmentation and non-autoregressive ASR to realize high accuracy and low RTF ASR. As a non-autoregressive ASR, the insertion-based model is used. In addition, instead of concatenating separated models for segmentation and ASR, we introduce a new architecture that realizes audio segmentation and non-autoregressive ASR by a single neural network. Experimental results on Japanese and English dataset show that the method achieved a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and RTF compared with baseline autoregressive Transformer and connectionist temporal classification.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "92acaf505a9c738e56ed70759e8d0062f3c520d6", "arXivId": "2012.10128", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10128.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yuya Fujita", "Tianzi Wang", "Shinji Watanabe", "Motoi Omachi"]}
