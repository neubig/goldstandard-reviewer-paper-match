{"title": "Correlation between the structural and antiferromagnetic phase transitions in ZnCr2Se4", "abstract": "Structural properties of normal\u2010type spinel ZnCr2Se4 have been studied as a function of temperature by means of neutron diffraction. It is found that the structural phase transition (TC) from a cubic to orthorhombic symmetry simultaneously occurs at the antiferromagnetic phase transition temperature (TN \u223c 21 K), where the cubic and orthorhombic symmetry is 7Oh\u2010Fd3m and 24D2h\u2010Fddd, respectively. The structural phase transition is mainly characterized by the cooperative displacements of Se2\u2013 ions, which are induced by a magnetostriction resulting from the magnetic interaction of Cr3+ ions in CrSe4 chains along [110]. The antiferromagnetic magnetic structure below TN is made by a spiral magnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic CrSe4 chains around crystallographic screw axes, which are parallel to an orthorhombic C axis. The spiral long\u2010range order of the spins of Cr3+ is incommensurate and its periodicity of q along a reciprocal lattice axis C* shows temperature dependence from about 0.47 (2.5 K) to 0.43 (18 K). The spiral periodicity of the spin order along the C axis shows a first order transition at about 21 K.", "year": 2003, "ssId": "edb49aa423afc210facec998277923c4b75e4648", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["M.
