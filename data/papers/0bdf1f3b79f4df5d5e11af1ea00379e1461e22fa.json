{"title": "Automated Dependency Plots", "abstract": "In practical applications of machine learning, it is necessary to look beyond standard metrics such as test accuracy in order to validate various qualitative properties such as monotonicity with respect to a feature or combination of features, checking for undesirable changes or oscillations in the response, and differences in outcomes (e.g., discrimination) for a protected class. Partial dependence plots (PDP), including instance-specific PDPs (i.e., ICE plots), have been widely used as a visual way to understand or validate a model. In particular, PDPs visualize the model response as one feature is changed while holding other features fixed via an intuitive line graph. Yet, current PDPs suffer from two main drawbacks: (1) a user must manually sort or select interesting plots, and (2) PDPs are usually limited to plots along a single feature. To address these drawbacks, we formalize a method for automating the selection of interesting PDPs and extend PDPs beyond showing single features to show the model response along arbitrary directions, for example in raw feature spaces or a latent space arising from some generative model. We demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed PDP generalization across multiple use-cases and datasets including selecting between two models and understanding out-of-sample behavior.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "0bdf1f3b79f4df5d5e11af1ea00379e1461e22fa", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["David I.
