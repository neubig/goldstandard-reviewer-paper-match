{"title": "Recognizing Structure in Web Pages using Similarity Queries", "abstract": "We present general-purpose methods for recognizing certain types of structure in HTML documents. The methods are implemented using WHIRL, a \"soft\" logic that incorporates a notion of textual similarity developed in the information retrieval community. In an experimental evaluation on 82 Web pages, the structure ranked first by our method is \"meaningful\"--i.e., a structure that was used in a hand-coded \"wrapper\", or extraction program, for the page-nearly 70% of the time. This improves on a value of 50% obtained by an earlier method. With appropriate background information, the structure-recognition methods we describe can also be used to learn a wrapper from examples, or for maintaining a wrapper as a Web page changes format. In these settings, the top-ranked structure is meaningful nearly 85% of the time.", "year": 1999, "ssId": "ddc502b6c0d08fefe5b77639e4737cd8c7bce25c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
