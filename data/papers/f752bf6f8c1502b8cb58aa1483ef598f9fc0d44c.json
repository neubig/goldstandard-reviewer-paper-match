{"title": "Counting, Ranking, and Randomly Generating CP-Nets", "abstract": "We introduce a method for generating CP-nets uniformly at random. As CP-nets encode a subset of partial orders, ensuring that we generate samples uniformly at random is not a trivial task. We present algorithms for counting CP-nets, ranking and computing the rank of an arbitrary CP-net for a given number of nodes, and generating a CP-net given its rank. We also show how to generate all CP-nets with a given number of nodes.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "f752bf6f8c1502b8cb58aa1483ef598f9fc0d44c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["T.
