{"title": "Factor Graph Grammars", "abstract": "We propose the use of hyperedge replacement graph grammars for factor graphs, or factor graph grammars (FGGs) for short. FGGs generate sets of factor graphs and can describe a more general class of models than plate notation, dynamic graphical models, case-factor diagrams, and sum-product networks can. Moreover, inference can be done on FGGs without enumerating all the generated factor graphs. For finite variable domains (but possibly infinite sets of graphs), a generalization of variable elimination to FGGs allows exact and tractable inference in many situations. For finite sets of graphs (but possibly infinite variable domains), a FGG can be converted to a single factor graph amenable to standard inference techniques.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "2e492af839e971d05592df1c76d4878908e1d4c0", "arXivId": "2010.12048", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12048.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["David Chiang", "Darcey Riley"]}
