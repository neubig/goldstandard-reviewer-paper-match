{"title": "Taming the Monster: A Fast and Simple Algorithm for Contextual Bandits", "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for the contextual bandit learning problem, where the learner repeatedly takes one of K actions in response to the observed context, and observes the reward only for that action. Our method assumes access to an oracle for solving fully supervised cost-sensitive classification problems and achieves the statistically optimal regret guarantee with only O(\u221aKT) oracle calls across all T rounds. By doing so, we obtain the most practical contextual bandit learning algorithm amongst approaches that work for general policy classes. We conduct a proof-of-concept experiment which demonstrates the excellent computational and statistical performance of (an online variant of) our algorithm relative to several strong baselines.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "89c2cbdf1a5049a4068ca9215aa8859a1a97b1a3", "arXivId": "1402.0555", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.0555.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Alekh Agarwal", "Daniel J.
