{"title": "The Complexity of Lobbying in an Uncertain World ( Extended Abstract )", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a formal model for lobbying in a probabilistic environment. We offer two distinct models in which an actor can influence a voter\u2019s preferences of voting for or against multiple issues when the voter\u2019s preferences are represented in terms of the probability that they will vote as desired on each issue. We determine that the choice of evaluation and bribery criteria has significant influence on the computational complexity of the bribery problem. We provide three evaluation criteria and three bribery criteria for these models in order to explore their different effects on the resulting complexity. We give a formal complexity analysis for these problems and conclude that lobbying in a stochastic environment can be computationally complex.", "year": 2008, "ssId": "614dc4001ad68cac31484887f16542f04693eca4", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nicholas Mattei", "J.
