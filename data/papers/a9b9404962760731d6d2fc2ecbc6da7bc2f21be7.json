{"title": "Voice Activity Detection Using Dirichlet Prior", "abstract": "This paper introduce the Drichlet prior into a statistical model-based voice activity detection (VAD), and shows its advantage. The statistical modelbased VAD identify speech / non-speech period based on environmental adapted speech and non-speech GMMs which are constructed by the Switching Kalman filter. The constructed GMMs include important and unimportant Gaussian distributions. Thus, the performance of VAD can be improved by reducing unimportant Gaussian distribution. Here, prior probabilities of each remaining distribution may drastically change, because the distribution shape after the Gaussian reduction is much different from original GMM. Thus, we propose an optimization method of prior probabilities by using the Drichlet prior.", "year": 2009, "ssId": "a9b9404962760731d6d2fc2ecbc6da7bc2f21be7", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["M.
