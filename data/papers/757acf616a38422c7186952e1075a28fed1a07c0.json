{"title": "Xylazole inhibits NO-cGMP pathway in fetal rat nerve cells", "abstract": "Background Xylazole (Xyl) is a veterinary anesthetic that is structurally and functionally similar to xylazine. However, the effects of Xyl in vitro remain unknown. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the anesthetic mechanism of Xyl using fetal rat nerve cells treated with Xyl. Methods Fetal rat nerve cells cultured for seven days were treated with 10, 20, 30, and 40 \u03bcg/ mL Xyl for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min. Variations of amino acid neurotransmitters (AANTs), Nitric oxide-Cyclic GMP (NO-cGMP) signaling pathway, and ATPase were evaluated. Results Xyl decreased the levels of cGMP and NO in nerve cells. Furthermore, Xyl affected the AANT content and Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase activity in nerve cells. These findings suggested that Xyl inhibited the NO-cGMP signaling pathway in nerve cells in vitro. Conclusions This study provided new evidence that the anesthetic and analgesic effects of Xyl are related to the inhibition of the NO-cGMP signaling pathway.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "757acf616a38422c7186952e1075a28fed1a07c0", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Xinyu Wang", "Yue Wu", "Lin Liu", "Hui Bai", "Zhiheng Zhang", "Mingchao Zhao", "Tianwen Ma", "Xiaopeng Song", "Lina Jia", "Liang Lv", "Yue Yu", "Xinyu Xu", "Hong Chen", "Li Gao"]}
