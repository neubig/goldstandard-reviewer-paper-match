{"title": "NTT-NAIST syntax-based SMT systems for IWSLT 2014", "abstract": "This paper presents NTT-NAIST SMT systems for English-German and German-English MT tasks of the IWSLT 2014 evaluation campaign. The systems are based on generalized minimum Bayes risk system combination of three SMT systems using the forest-to-string, syntactic preordering, and phrase-based translation formalisms. Individual systems employ training data selection for domain adaptation, truecasing, compound word splitting (for GermanEnglish), interpolated n-gram language models, and hypotheses rescoring using recurrent neural network language models.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "d95b66901d72a13d0c96c7e9bfd4a999ed7fb19c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Katsuhito Sudoh", "Graham Neubig", "Kevin Duh", "K.
