{"title": "Learning and Discovering Structure in Web Pages", "abstract": "Because much of the information on the web is presented in some sort of regular, repeated format, \u201cunderstanding\u201d web pages often requires recognizing and using structure, where structure is typically defined by hyperlinks between pages and HTML formatting commands within a page. We survey some of the ways in which structure within a web page can be used to help machines understand pages. Specifically, we review past research on techniques that automatically learn and discover web-page structure. These techniques are important for wrapper-learning, an important and active research area, and can be beneficial for tasks as diverse as classification of entities mentioned on the web, collaborative filtering for music, web page classification, and entity extraction from web pages.", "year": 2003, "ssId": "8234049255a0e03fc745457de456634d1aab214b", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
