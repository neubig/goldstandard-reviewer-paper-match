{"title": "Shape-engineering of organic heterostructures via a sequential self-assembly strategy for multi-channel photon transportation", "abstract": "The controlled self-assembly of organic heterostructures (OHSs) with precisely defined compositions, architectures, and interfaces, have largely remained a challenge. Herein, we introduce an effective approach to accurately construct three types of axial branching OHSs including unilateral axial OHSs, bilateral single-branching axial OHSs and bilateral multi-branching axial OHSs through modulating hierarchical charge-transfer intermolecular interactions and sequential crystal nucleation rate on account of the two different cocrystals with the low lattice mismatching rate of \u223c 2.2%. The present work opens an avenue for rationally designing and finely synthesizing more kinds of OHSs.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "7abcc79e10ff651ef59dea84d347fa64c51e11b2", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yue Yu", "Qiang Lv", "Yi Yuan", "Xue\u2010Dong Wang", "Liangsheng Liao"]}
