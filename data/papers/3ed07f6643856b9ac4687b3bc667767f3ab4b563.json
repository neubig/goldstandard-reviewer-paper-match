{"title": "Design of control parameters for voice quality control based on multiple-regression Gaussian mixture model", "abstract": "This report presents a method for designing control parameters in statistical voice quality control. As a method for intuitively controlling converted voice quality, a voice quality control method based on multiple-regression Gaussian mixture model (MR-GMM) was proposed. In this method, perceptual scores corresponding to voice quality expression words are manually assigned to individual pre-stored target speakers for statistically modeling a correspondence between acoustic features and the perceptual scores. Therefore, performance of voice quality control highly depends on a selection of voice quality expression words and accuracy of the perceptual score assignment. In this report, to achieve better voice quality control using multiple voice quality expression words, we propose a method for selecting voice quality expression words and assigning corresponding perceptual scores considering both independency of the perceptual scores and independency of acoustic features corresponding to them in the MR-GMM. Experimental results show that the performance of voice quality control is significantly improved by the", "year": 2014, "ssId": "3ed07f6643856b9ac4687b3bc667767f3ab4b563", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kubo Kazutaka", "Kobayashi Kazuhiro", "T.
