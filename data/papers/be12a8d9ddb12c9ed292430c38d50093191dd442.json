{"title": "Equidistant Nodes Clustering: a Soft Clustering Algorithm Applied for Synset Induction", "abstract": "In this paper, we present an algorithm for fuzzy graph clustering called Equidistant Nodes Clustering (ENC). In the core of the algorithm there is an assumption that the nodes in a community can reach each other within a limited number of steps. We describe the algorithm and apply it to a natural language processing task of synset induction. The experimental results show that ENC outperforms popular clustering algorithms as according to a gold standard evaluation.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "be12a8d9ddb12c9ed292430c38d50093191dd442", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["M.
