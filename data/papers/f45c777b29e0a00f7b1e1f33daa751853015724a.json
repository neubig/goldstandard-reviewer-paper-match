This includes areas such as\n autonomous agents, cognitive modeling, computer vision, constraint programming, human language technologies, intelligent user interfaces, knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, planning and search, problem solving and robotics.\n Members of ACM SIGAI come from academia, industry and government agencies worldwide. ACM SIGAI is proud of the fact that many AI researchers in the past year received ACM honors, including becoming ACM fellows as well as receiving other awards.\n ACM SIGAI is committed to increase its activities in order to support its members even better. In order to do so, ACM SIGAI has created several new appointed officer positions, namely an industry liaison officer, an award officer and two ethics officers.\n In the course of the last year, ACM SIGAI has been responsive to specific events and circumstances as well as continued to support and expand a range of regular activities.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "f45c777b29e0a00f7b1e1f33daa751853015724a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Sven Koenig", "Sanmay Das", "Rosemary D.
