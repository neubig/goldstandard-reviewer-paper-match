{"title": "Joint Modeling of Code-Switched and Monolingual ASR via Conditional Factorization", "abstract": "Conversational bilingual speech encompasses three types of utterances: two purely monolingual types and one intra-sententially code-switched type. In this work, we propose a general framework to jointly model the likelihoods of the monolingual and code-switch sub-tasks that comprise bilingual speech recognition. By defining the monolingual sub-tasks with label-to-frame synchronization, our joint modeling framework can be conditionally factorized such that the final bilingual output, which may or may not be code-switched, is obtained given only monolingual information. We show that this conditionally factorized joint framework can be modeled by an endto-end differentiable neural network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model on bilingual Mandarin-English speech recognition across both monolingual and code-switched corpora.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "17c5e16d16585a01fbfd90ff39f6799952675b21", "arXivId": "2111.15016", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.15016.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Brian Yan", "Chunlei Zhang", "Meng Yu", "Shi-Xiong Zhang", "Siddharth Dalmia", "Dan Berrebbi", "Chao Weng", "Shinji Watanabe", "Dong Yu"]}
