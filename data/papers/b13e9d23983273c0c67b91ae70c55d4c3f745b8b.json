{"title": "Learning to Translate in Real-time with Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Translating in real-time, a.k.a.simultaneous translation, outputs translation words before the input sentence ends, which is a challenging problem for conventional machine translation methods. We propose a neural machine translation (NMT) framework for simultaneous translation in which an agent learns to make decisions on when to translate from the interaction with a pre-trained NMT environment. To trade off quality and delay, we extensively explore various targets for delay and design a method for beam-search applicable in the simultaneous MT setting. Experiments against state-of-the-art baselines on two language pairs demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework both quantitatively and qualitatively.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "b13e9d23983273c0c67b91ae70c55d4c3f745b8b", "arXivId": "1610.00388", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00388.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Graham Neubig", "Kyunghyun Cho", "Jiatao Gu", "V.
