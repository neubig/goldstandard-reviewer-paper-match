{"title": "JAAE: the java abstract annotation editor", "abstract": "Recent trends in NLP (Natural Language Processing) are heading towards a stochastic processing of natural language. Stochastic methods, however, usually demand a lot of annotated training data. In most cases, the annotation of the data has to be done manually by a team of annotators and it is a highly timeconsuming and expensive process. Thus we tried to develop an efficient and user-friendly editor that would aid human annotators to create the annotated data. We offer this editor for free. The developed editor is described in this article.", "year": 2007, "ssId": "05c2bb89a5c42ad7932420bb39df2e566df6e1ec", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ivan Habernal", "Miloslav Konop\u00edk"]}
