{"title": "Optimal Impromptu Deployment of A Multi-Hop Wireless Network On a Random Lattice Path", "abstract": "We consider the problem of impromptu deployment of a multihop wireless network as a deployment operative steps along a random lattice path, with a Markov evolution. At each step, with various probabilities, the path can either continue in the same direction or can take a turn \u201cNorth\u201d or \u201cEast,\u201d or can come to an end, at which point a sensor needs to be placed to send some measurements to a base station near the origin of the path. A decision has to be made at each step whether or not to place a wireless relay node. The problem is motivated by the growing need for emergency first-responders (such as fire-fighters) to deploy sensors for situational awareness (e.g., temperature sensors on fire-doors). Assuming that the measurement traffic generated by the sensor is very low, and simple link-by-link scheduling, we consider the problem of relay placement so as to minimize an end-to-end cost metric, a linear combination of the sum of convex hop costs, and the number of relays placed. In one version, radio propagation is possible only along the straight line segments in the path. In another version, propagation is allowed between any pair of points on the path. In each case, the impromptu relay placement problem is formulated as a total cost Markov decision process. We provide results on the structure of the optimal sequential placement policies, and show how the structure changes with variation of some parameters of the model. We compare the performance of the optimal policy with that of the heuristic of placing a relay when the distance from the previously placed relay exceeds a certain threshold.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "7891ec1d8ba2abf238326dc6e8862cc4431a6f5c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Abhishek Sinha", "Arpan Chattopadhyay"]}
