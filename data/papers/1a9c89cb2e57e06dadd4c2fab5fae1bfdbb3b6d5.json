{"title": "Voting with CP-nets using a Probabilistic Preference Structure", "abstract": "Probabilistic conditional preference networks (PCP-nets) provide a compact representation of a probability distribution over a collection of CP-nets. In this paper we view a PCP-net as the result of aggregating a collection of CP-nets into a single structure. We use the resulting PCP-net to perform collective reasoning tasks, e.g. determining the most preferred alternative, when a group of agents expresses their preferences via CP-nets. We propose several PCP-net based methods to perform CPnet aggregation and evaluate these methods both axiomatically and experimentally.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "1a9c89cb2e57e06dadd4c2fab5fae1bfdbb3b6d5", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Cristina Cornelio", "Umberto Grandi", "J.
