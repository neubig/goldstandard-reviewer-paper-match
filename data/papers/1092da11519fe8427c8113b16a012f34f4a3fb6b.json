{"title": "Federated Learning Meets Fairness and Differential Privacy", "abstract": "Deep learning\u2019s unprecedented success raises several ethical concerns ranging from biased predictions to data privacy. Researchers tackle these issues by introducing fairness metrics, or federated learning, or differential privacy. A first, this work presents an ethical federated learning model, incorporating all three measures simultaneously. Experiments on the Adult, Bank and Dutch datasets highlight the resulting \u201cempirical interplay\u201d between accuracy, fairness, and privacy.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "1092da11519fe8427c8113b16a012f34f4a3fb6b", "arXivId": "2108.09932", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09932.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["P.
