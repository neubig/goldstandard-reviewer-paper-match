{"title": "A method for optimization of fuzzy reasoning by genetic algorithms and its application to discrimination of myocardial heart disease", "abstract": "Describes a method for optimizing the parameters of fuzzy rules using genetic algorithms (GAs) for classification of myocardial heart disease from ultrasonic images. Gaussian-distributed membership functions (GDMFs) constructed from the texture features inherent in the ultrasound images are used, and the coefficients acted as a set of parameters to adjust the magnitudes of the standard deviations of the GDMEs are employed. Optimal coefficients are determined through training process using the GA. The GA-based fuzzy classifier is used to discriminate two sets of echocardiographic images, namely, normal and abnormal cases, diagnosed by a highly trained physician. The results of the authors' experiments are very promising. In the best case, they achieve a classification rate of 95.8%. The results indicate that the method has potential utility for computer-aided diagnosis of myocardial heart disease.", "year": 1998, "ssId": "97e8430fe01394ea9a49fd841d9aecdfc294a796", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["D.
