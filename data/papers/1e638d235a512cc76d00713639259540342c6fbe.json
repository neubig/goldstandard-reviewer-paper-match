{"title": "The UWNLP system at SemEval-2018 Task 7: Neural Relation Extraction Model with Selectively Incorporated Concept Embeddings", "abstract": "This paper describes our submission for SemEval 2018 Task 7 shared task on semantic relation extraction and classification in scientific papers. Our model is based on the end-to-end relation extraction model of (Miwa and Bansal, 2016) with several enhancements such as character-level encoding attention mechanism on selecting pretrained concept candidate embeddings. Our official submission ranked the second in relation classification task (Subtask 1.1 and Subtask 2 Senerio 2), and the first in the relation extraction task (Subtask 2 Scenario 1).", "year": 2018, "ssId": "1e638d235a512cc76d00713639259540342c6fbe", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yi Luan", "Mari Ostendorf", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"]}
