{"title": "Modeling Curbside Parking as a Network of Finite Capacity Queues", "abstract": "Paid curbside parking can be advantageously modeled as a network of interdependent queues. To this end, we introduce methods for analyzing a special class of networks of finite capacity queues where drivers arrive from an exogenous source, join the queue if there is an available parking space, or continue to search at an adjacent queue for an available space. Furthermore, we apply this model to estimate the proportion of drivers cruising in the neighborhood of Belltown, Seattle, WA, USA. Using occupancy approximated by parking transaction data, we estimate the percentage of drivers cruising for curbside parking by comparing the rate of drivers unable to find parking to bulk through-traffic measurement data. We find percentages of up to 50% for a Belltown\u2019s 1st Ave. depending on the time, day, and direction of travel. We then calculate a per vehicle travel-time cost to social welfare incurred by this proportion: upward of a 10% increase in travel time to all drivers along 1st Ave. Last, we introduce a simulation tool and test assumptions made when estimating interesting performance metrics like the probability of a block-face being full. Our results suggest that while assuming exponential service time distributions is not justified, mean rate solutions under a Markovian relaxation of the problem is comparable to service times representative of parking transaction data in simulation.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "d6a7d2e9f2caf3e8eb615580f4ee8329ff9a271d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Chase P.
