{"title": "Uyghur morpheme-based language models and ASR", "abstract": "Uyghur language is an agglutinative language in which words are formed by suffixes attaching to a stem (or root). Because of the explosive nature in vocabulary of the agglutinative languages, several morpheme-based language models are built and experiments are implemented. Morpheme is the smallest meaning bearing unit. In this research, morpheme is referred to any of prefix, stem, or suffix. As a result, a large vocabulary ASR system is built on the basis of Julius system. Several ASR results on language models based on different units (word, morpheme, and syllable) are compared.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "2818bd090206ef33f9d7e1be03bc4f742c6762d1", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Mijit Ablimit", "Graham Neubig", "M.
