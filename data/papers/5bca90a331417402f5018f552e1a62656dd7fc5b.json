{"title": "On the Joint Recovery of Community Structure and Community Features", "abstract": "We study the problem of recovering both K communities and their features from a labeled graph observation. We assume that the edges of an observed graph are generated as per the symmetric Stochastic Block Model (SBM), and that the label of each node is a noisy and partially-observed version of the corresponding community feature. We characterize the information-theoretic limit of this problem, and then propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves the information-theoretic limit.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "5bca90a331417402f5018f552e1a62656dd7fc5b", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Jisang Yoon", "Kangwook Lee", "Changho Suh"]}
