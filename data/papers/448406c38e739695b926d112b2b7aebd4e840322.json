{"title": "Online meeting recognizer with multichannel speaker diarization", "abstract": "We present our newly developed real-time conversation analyzer for group meetings. The goal of the system is to estimate automatically \u201cwho speaks when and what\u201d in an online manner. In our system, \u201cwho speaks when\u201d information is first obtained by estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of signals. Then, \u201cwho speaks what\u201d is estimated with our automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, after suppressing reverberation, background noise, and interference speakers' voices. In this paper, we focus particularly on the speaker diarization (\u201cwho speaks when\u201d estimation) method, and we show that the speaker diarization information helps the ASR to reduce insertion errors.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "448406c38e739695b926d112b2b7aebd4e840322", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["S.
