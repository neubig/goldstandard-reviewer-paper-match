{"title": "Block-LDA: Jointly Modeling Entity-Annotated Text and Entity-Entity Links", "abstract": "Identifying latent groups of entities from observed interactions between pairs of entities is a frequently encountered problem in areas like analysis of protein interactions and social networks. We present a model that combines aspects of mixed membership stochastic block models and topic models to improve entity-entity link modeling by jointly modeling links and text about the entities that are linked. We apply the model to two datasets: a protein-protein interaction (PPI) dataset supplemented with a corpus of abstracts of scientific publications annotated with the proteins in the PPI dataset and an Enron email corpus. The model is evaluated by inspecting induced topics to understand the nature of the data and by quantitative methods such as functional category prediction of proteins and perplexity which exhibit improvements when joint modeling is used over baselines that use only link or text information.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "cdf17da4a7638985cb62a5dbf1161239b315eb85", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ramnath Balasubramanyan", "William W.
