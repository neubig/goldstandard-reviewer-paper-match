{"title": "Extreme Adaptation for Personalized Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Every person speaks or writes their own flavor of their native language, influenced by a number of factors: the content they tend to talk about, their gender, their social status, or their geographical origin. When attempting to perform Machine Translation (MT), these variations have a significant effect on how the system should perform translation, but this is not captured well by standard one-size-fits-all models. In this paper, we propose a simple and parameter-efficient adaptation technique that only requires adapting the bias of the output softmax to each particular user of the MT system, either directly or through a factored approximation. Experiments on TED talks in three languages demonstrate improvements in translation accuracy, and better reflection of speaker traits in the target text.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "032e660447156a045ad6cf50272bca46246f4645", "arXivId": "1805.01817", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01817.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Paul Michel", "Graham Neubig"]}
