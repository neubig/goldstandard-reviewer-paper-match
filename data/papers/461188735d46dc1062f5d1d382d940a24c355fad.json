{"title": "Automatic Extraction of Commonsense LocatedNear Knowledge", "abstract": "LocatedNear relation is a kind of commonsense knowledge describing two physical objects that are typically found near each other in real life. In this paper, we study how to automatically extract such relationship through a sentence-level relation classifier and aggregating the scores of entity pairs from a large corpus. Also, we release two benchmark datasets for evaluation and future research.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "461188735d46dc1062f5d1d382d940a24c355fad", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Frank F.
