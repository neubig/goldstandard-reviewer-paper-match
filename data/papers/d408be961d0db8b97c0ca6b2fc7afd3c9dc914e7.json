{"title": "Mobilytics- An Extensible, Modular and Resilient Mobility Platform", "abstract": "Transportation management platforms provide communities the ability to integrate the available mobility options and localized transportation demand management policies. A central component of a transportation management platform is the mobility planning application. Given the societal relevance of these platforms, it is necessary to ensure that they operate resiliently. Modularity and extensibility are also critical properties that are required for manageability. Modularity allows to isolate faults easily. Extensibility enables update of policies and integration of new mobility modes or new routing algorithms. However, state of the art mobility planning applications like open trip planner, are monolithic applications, which makes it difficult to scale and modify them dynamically. This paper describes a microservices based modular multi-modal mobility platform Mobilytics, that integrates mobility providers, commuters, and community stakeholders. We describe our requirements, architecture, and discuss the resilience challenges, and how our platform functions properly in presence of failure. Conceivably, the patterns and principles manifested in our system can serve as guidelines for current and future practitioners in this field.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "d408be961d0db8b97c0ca6b2fc7afd3c9dc914e7", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Chinmaya Samal", "A.
