{"title": "From Machine Learning Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference ML Fast E ective Rule Induction", "abstract": "Many existing rule learning systems are computationally expensive on large noisy datasets In this paper we evaluate the recently proposed rule learning algorithm IREP on a large and diverse collection of benchmark problems We show that while IREP is extremely e cient it frequently gives error rates higher than those of C and C rules We then propose a num ber of modi cations resulting in an algo rithm RIPPERk that is very competitive with C rules with respect to error rates but much more e cient on large samples RIPPERk obtains error rates lower than or equivalent to C rules on of bench mark problems scales nearly linearly with the number of training examples and can e ciently process noisy datasets containing hundreds of thousands of examples", "year": 1995, "ssId": "6c34b7b0441bff66cce2418d36acfd9776ad7bd2", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
