ABSTRACT Discriminative language modeling is a structured classification problem. Log-linear models have been previously used to address this problem. In this paper, the standard dot-product feature representation used in log-linear models is replaced by a non-linear function parameterized by a neural network. Embeddings are learned for each word and features are extracted automatically through the use of convolutional layers. Experimental results show that as a stand-alone model the continuous space model yields significantly lower word error rate (1% absolute), while having a much more compact parameterization (60%-90% smaller). If the baseline scores are combined, our approach performs equally well.", "year": null, "ssId": "c9ce3889c03fee2990b2277423bbc0fb4366df53", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["S.
