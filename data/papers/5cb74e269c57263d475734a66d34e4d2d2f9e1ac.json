{"title": "Vibration Characteristics of Truss Core Panels Based on Laser Additive Manufacturing", "abstract": "The dynamic behavior of structures, in particular, that of truss core panels base on laser additive manufacturing (LAM) is a subject of considerable current interest. In the present study, a finite element method (FEM) analysis of a sample constructed using LAM is compared with a modal test. The vibration characteristics of three core geometries: tetrahedral, pyramid and Kagome, are evaluated using the FEM.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "5cb74e269c57263d475734a66d34e4d2d2f9e1ac", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Guoli Wang", "Yi Luan", "Wei Yang", "Jian Wang"]}
