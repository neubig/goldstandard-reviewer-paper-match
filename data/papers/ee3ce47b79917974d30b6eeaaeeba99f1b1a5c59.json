{"title": "A Study of Transducer Based End-to-End ASR with ESPnet: Architecture, Auxiliary Loss and Decoding Strategies", "abstract": "In this study, we present recent developments of models trained with the RNN-T loss in ESPnet. It involves the use of various archi-tectures such as recently proposed Conformer, multi-task learning with different auxiliary criteria and multiple decoding strategies, in-cluding our own proposition. Through experiments and benchmarks, we show that our proposed systems can be competitive against other state-of-art systems on well-known datasets such as LibriSpeech and AISHELL-1. Additionally, we demonstrate that these models are promising against other already implemented systems in ESPnet in regards to both performance and decoding speed, enabling the pos-sibility to have powerful systems for a streaming task. With these additions, we hope to expand the usefulness of the ESPnet toolkit for the research community and also give tools for the ASR industry to deploy our systems in realistic and production environments.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "ee3ce47b79917974d30b6eeaaeeba99f1b1a5c59", "arXivId": "2201.05420", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05420.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Florian Boyer", "Yusuke Shinohara", "Takaaki Ishii", "H.
