{"title": "Characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome of Sinocyclocheilus wenshanensis (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae)", "abstract": "Abstract Sinocyclocheilus wenshanensis is a cyprinid fish species endemic to Southwestern China. In this study, we first sequenced and characterized the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of S. wenshanensis by next-generation sequencing method. The entire length of mitogenome is 16,595 base pairs (bp), containing 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and a control region. Its gene arrangement pattern was identical to other previously reported Sinocyclocheilus fishes. The overall base composition is 31.12% A, 16.63% G, 25.45% T, and 26.80% C, with AT content of 56.57%. Phylogenetic analysis using mitogenome of 26 Cyprinidae fishes showed that S. wenshanensis are closely related to S. aluensis and S. oxycephalus. This work would provide molecular information fundamental to future phylogenetic analyses among Sinocyclocheilus species.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "f1b52bf723d7f5c4b68c8551c4d168ed1224f016", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Chunqing Li", "Fang-Hua Hu", "Junxian He", "Xutong Li", "Hong-fu Yang", "Wei-xian Li", "Shanyuan Chen", "Heng Xiao"]}
