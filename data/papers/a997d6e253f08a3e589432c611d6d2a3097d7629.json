{"title": "Research Exchange-A Collaborative Paper Annotation Tool", "abstract": "This research looks to explore the requirements, development, and efficacy of the online research paper tool-Research Exchange. Based on surveying graduate and undergraduate research students, it was found that getting started with research is a huge undertaking and requires constant guidance of immediate peers and professors. To address these issues, a collaborative online research tool was designed to help young researchers understand concepts on the fly. To understand whether the tool helps achieving the desired goal, usability studies were conducted to understand the usability and functionality issues of the tool. It was found that collaboration using annotations was extremely beneficial for users which were in line with our findings from the requirement phase. Additionally, it was noted that users appreciated the online reader and were open to trying it from the existing pdf solutions. However, many users noted several additional features that would be necessary to make this product useful. Future work involves improving the prototype and integration of the OpenReview APIs for large scale deployment. Our final prototype can be found on http://researchexchange.cs.umass.edu:3000/.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "a997d6e253f08a3e589432c611d6d2a3097d7629", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kalpesh Krishna", "Yue-Cen Liu", "Shashank Mehrotra", "Jiazheng Zhu"]}
