{"title": "Findings of the WMT 2020 Shared Task on Machine Translation Robustness", "abstract": "We report the findings of the second edition of the shared task on improving robustness in Machine Translation (MT). The task aims to test current machine translation systems in their ability to handle challenges facing MT models to be deployed in the real world, including domain diversity and non-standard texts common in user generated content, especially in social media. We cover two language pairs \u2013 English-German and English-Japanese and provide test sets in zero-shot and few-shot variants. Participating systems are evaluated both automatically and manually, with an additional human evaluation for \u201dcatastrophic errors\u201d. We received 59 submissions by 11 participating teams from a variety of types of institutions.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "c204d40384d39c59cd7249bde4cd8615972acaac", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Lucia Specia", "Zhenhao Li", "J.
