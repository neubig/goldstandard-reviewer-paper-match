{"title": "Accelerated Directional Search and Derivative-Free Methods with non-euclidian prox-structure", "abstract": "In the paper we propose an accelerated directional search method with non-euclidian prox-structure. We consider convex unconstraint optimization problem in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For simplicity we start from the zero point. We expect in advance that 1-norm of the solution is close enough to its 2-norm. In this case the standard accelerated Nesterov's directional search method can be improved. In the paper we show how to make Nesterov's method $n$-times faster (up to a $\\log n$-factor) in this case. The basic idea is to use linear coupling, proposed by Allen-Zhu & Orecchia in 2014, and to make Grad-step in 2-norm, but Mirr-step in 1-norm. We show that for constraint optimization problem this approach stable upon an obstacle. We generalize this result to accelerated gradient-free methods with inexact oracle (here we use the very recent work of Dvurechensky, Gasnikov, Tiurin, 2017).", "year": 2017, "ssId": "2d3fcbaf28e650471b942f221c5fa3c178b1b72a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
