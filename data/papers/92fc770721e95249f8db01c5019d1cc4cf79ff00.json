{"title": "A natural language query system for Hubble Space Telescope proposal selection", "abstract": "The proposal selection process for the Hubble Space Telescope is assisted by a robust and easy to use query program (TACOS). The system parses an English subset language sentence regardless of the order of the keyword phases, allowing the user a greater flexibility than a standard command query language. Capabilities for macro and procedure definition are also integrated. The system was designed for flexibility in both use and maintenance. In addition, TACOS can be applied to any knowledge domain that can be expressed in terms of a single reaction. The system was implemented mostly in Common LISP. The TACOS design is described in detail, with particular attention given to the implementation methods of sentence processing.", "year": 1987, "ssId": "92fc770721e95249f8db01c5019d1cc4cf79ff00", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["T.
