{"title": "Approximate Gaussian process inference for the drift function in stochastic differential equations", "abstract": "We introduce a nonparametric approach for estimating drift functions in systems of stochastic differential equations from incomplete observations of the state vector. Using a Gaussian process prior over the drift as a function of the state vector, we develop an approximate EM algorithm to deal with the unobserved, latent dynamics between observations. The posterior over states is approximated by a piecewise linearized process and the MAP estimation of the drift is facilitated by a sparse Gaussian process regression.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "76b95833fd0e242896d231abdea8dc01a167c7a6", "arXivId": null, "link": "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/021bbc7ee20b71134d53e20206bd6feb-Paper.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Andreas Ruttor", "Philipp Batz", "M.
