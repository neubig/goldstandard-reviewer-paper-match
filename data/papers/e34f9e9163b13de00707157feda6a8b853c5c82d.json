{"title": "Eliminating Fuzzy Duplicates in Crowdsourced Lexical Resources", "abstract": "Collaboratively created lexical resources is a trending approach to creating high quality thesauri in a short time span at a remarkably low price. The key idea is to invite non-expert participants to express and share their knowledge with the aim of constructing a resource. However, this approach tends to be noisy and error-prone, thus making data cleansing a highly topical task to perform. In this paper, we study different techniques for synset deduplication including machine- and crowd-based ones. Eventually, we put forward an approach that can solve the deduplication problem fully automatically, with the quality comparable to the expert-based approach.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "e34f9e9163b13de00707157feda6a8b853c5c82d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Y.
