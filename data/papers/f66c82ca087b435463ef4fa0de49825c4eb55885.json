{"title": "Hybrid Semantic Analysis System - ATIS Data Evaluation", "abstract": "In this article we show a novel method of semantic parsing. The method deals with two main issues. First, it is developed to be reliable and easy to use. It uses a simple tree-based semantic annotation and it learns from data. Second, it is designed to be used in practical applications by incorporating a method for data formalization into the system. The system uses a novel parser that extends a general probabilistic context-free parser by using context for better probability estimation. The semantic parser was originally developed for Czech data and for written questions. In this article we show an evaluation of the method on a very different domain - ATIS corpus. The achieved results are very encouraging considering the difficulties connected with the ATIS corpus.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "f66c82ca087b435463ef4fa0de49825c4eb55885", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ivan Habernal", "Miloslav Konop\u00edk"]}
