{"title": "Removal of silent pauses and stuttered speech recognition by MFCC and K-means algorithm", "abstract": "Speech is the basic means of communication which humans use to express their thoughts, feelings and ideas. Fluency measures the effectiveness of speech in delivering information while communicating with another person. Stuttering is a speech disorder which affects the normal fluency of speech. The individuals with this disorder find it difficult to speak fluently. Silent-pauses, repetitions, prolongations, interjections are some of the characteristics of dysfluency.The presence of silent pauses in speech affects the fluency of it.Mel frequency coefficients and K-means clustering algorithm provides the optimal solution in each and every aspects.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "83a2582b94aeaaa97b2f52af8d827d28dc4690bf", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["K.
