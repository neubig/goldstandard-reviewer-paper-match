{"title": "Subspace pursuit method for kernel-log-linear models", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for reducing the dimensionality of kernel spaces. Recently, to maintain the convexity of training, log-linear models without mixtures have been used as emission probability density functions in hidden Markov models for automatic speech recognition. In that framework, nonlinearly-transformed high-dimensional features are used to achieve the nonlinear classification of the original observation vectors without using mixtures. In this paper, with the goal of using high-dimensional features in kernel spaces, the cutting plane subspace pursuit method proposed for support vector machines is generalized and applied to log-linear models. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved an efficient approximation of the feature space by using a limited number of basis vectors", "year": 2011, "ssId": "433b24d63146605d25c0c271062e129608462f03", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yotaro Kubo", "Simon Wiesler", "R.
