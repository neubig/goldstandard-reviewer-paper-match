{"title": "UCL+Sheffield at SemEval-2016 Task 8: Imitation learning for AMR parsing with an alpha-bound", "abstract": "We develop a novel transition-based parsing algorithm for the abstract meaning representation parsing task using exact imitation learning, in which the parser learns a statistical model by imitating the actions of an expert on the training data. We then use the imitation learning algorithm DAGGER to improve the performance, and apply an \u03b1-bound as a simple noise reduction technique. Our performance on the test set was 60% in F-score, and the performance gains on the development set due to DAGGER was up to 1.1 points of Fscore. The \u03b1-bound improved performance by up to 1.8 points.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "9ca95a09c8bf2d7d28234ff37ece182836dd8632", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["J.
