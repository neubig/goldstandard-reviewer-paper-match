That is, there exists an open-dense subset of zero-sum games for which local Nash equilibria are nondegenerate differential Nash equilibria. The result extends previous results to the zero-sum setting, where we obtain even stronger results; in particular, we show that local Nash equilibria are generically hyperbolic critical points. We further show that differential Nash equilibria of zero-sum games are structurally stable. The purpose for presenting these extensions is the recent renewed interest in zero-sum games within machine learning and optimization. Adversarial learning and generative adversarial network approaches are touted to be more robust than the alternative. Zero-sum games are at the heart of such approaches. Many works proceed under the assumption of hyperbolicity of critical points. Our results justify this assumption by showing \u2018almost all\u2019 zero-sum games admit local Nash equilibria that are hyperbolic.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "798e45ea830884be36c3f526d3b169eaba95f989", "arXivId": "2002.01007", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01007.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Eric V.
