{"title": "Bootstrapping the Recognition and Anaphoric Linking of Named Entities in Drosophila Articles", "abstract": "This paper demonstrates how Drosophila gene name recognition and anaphoric linking of gene names and their products can be achieved using existing information in FlyBase and the Sequence Ontology. Extending an extant approach to gene name recognition we achieved a F-score of 0.8559, and we report a preliminary experiment using a baseline anaphora resolution algorithm. We also present guidelines for annotation of gene mentions in texts and outline how the resulting system is used to aid FlyBase curation.", "year": 2005, "ssId": "48aced0919e29722d6eed9544353d5507c541cfc", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andreas Vlachos", "C.
