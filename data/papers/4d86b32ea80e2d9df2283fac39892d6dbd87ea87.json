{"title": "Large Geometric Margin Minimum Error Classification", "abstract": "The recent dramatic growth of computation power has resulted in increased interest in discriminative training methods for pattern recognition. Minimum Classification Error (MCE) training is especially attracting a great deal of attention, and it can be used to achieve minimum-error classification of various types of patterns. However, for increasing the robustness of classification, the conventional MCE framework has no practical optimization procedures like the geometric margin maximization in Support Vector Machine (SVM). To realize high robustness in a wide range of classification tasks, we derive the geometric margin for a general class of discriminant functions and develop a new MCE training method that increases the geometric margin value. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method by experiments using prototype-based classifiers and clarify relationships between the new method and such existing methods as SVM.", "year": 2009, "ssId": "4d86b32ea80e2d9df2283fac39892d6dbd87ea87", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["S.
