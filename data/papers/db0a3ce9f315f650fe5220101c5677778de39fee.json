{"title": "Inducing a Discriminative Parser to Optimize Machine Translation Reordering", "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for learning a discriminative parser for machine translation reordering using only aligned parallel text. This is done by treating the parser's derivation tree as a latent variable in a model that is trained to maximize reordering accuracy. We demonstrate that efficient large-margin training is possible by showing that two measures of reordering accuracy can be factored over the parse tree. Using this model in the pre-ordering framework results in significant gains in translation accuracy over standard phrase-based SMT and previously proposed unsupervised syntax induction methods.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "db0a3ce9f315f650fe5220101c5677778de39fee", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Graham Neubig", "Taro Watanabe", "Shinsuke Mori"]}
