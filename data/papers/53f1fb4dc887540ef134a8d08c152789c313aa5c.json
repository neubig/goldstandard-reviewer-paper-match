{"title": "Composite embedding systems for ZeroSpeech2017 Track1", "abstract": "This paper investigates novel composite embedding systems for language-independent high-performance feature extraction using triphone-based DNN-HMM and character-based end-to-end speech recognition systems. The DNN-HMM is trained with phoneme transcripts based on a large-scale Japanese ASR recipe included in the Kaldi toolkit from the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) with some modifications. The end-to-end ASR system is based on a hybrid architecture consisting of an attention-based encoder-decoder and connectionist temporal classification. This model is trained with multi-language speech data using character transcripts in a pure end-to-end fashion without requiring phonemic representation. Posterior features, PCA-transformed features, and bottleneck features are extracted from the two systems; then, various combinations of features are explored. Additionally, a bypassed autoencoder (bypassed AE) is proposed to normalize speaker characteristics in an unsupervised manner. An evaluation using the ABX test showed that the DNN-HMM-based CSJ bottleneck features resulted in a good performance regardless of the input language. The pre-activation vectors extracted from the multilingual end-to-end system with PCA provided a somewhat better performance than did the CSJ bottleneck features. The bypassed AE yielded an improved performance over a baseline AE. The lowest error rates were obtained by composite features that concatenated the end-to-end features with the CSJ bottleneck features.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "53f1fb4dc887540ef134a8d08c152789c313aa5c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Hayato Shibata", "Taku Kato", "T.
