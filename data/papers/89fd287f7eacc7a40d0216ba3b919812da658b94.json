{"title": "Deep inference of latent dynamics with spatio-temporal super-resolution using selective backpropagation through time", "abstract": "LFADS models benefit from appropriate hyperparameter (HP) tuning, as optimal HP combinations can vary from dataset to dataset [2, 3]. As mentioned in the main text, we use AutoLFADS [3] to ensure appropriate HP tuning. The framework combines a regularization strategy (coordinated dropout; CD [2]) with a largescale framework for optimizing model hyperparameters (population-based training; PBT [4]). The details of these strategies are outlined in previous work; here we provide specifics for replicating our findings.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "89fd287f7eacc7a40d0216ba3b919812da658b94", "arXivId": "2111.00070", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00070.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Feng Zhu", "Andrew R.
