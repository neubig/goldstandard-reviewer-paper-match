{"title": "Adapting Serious Game for Fallacious Argumentation to German: Pitfalls, Insights, and Best Practices", "abstract": "As argumentation about controversies is culture- and language-dependent, porting a serious game that deals with daily argumentation to another language requires substantial adaptation. This article presents a study of deploying Argotario (serious game for learning argumentation fallacies) into the German context. We examine all steps that are necessary to end up with a successful serious game platform, such as topic selection, initial data creation, or effective campaigns. Moreover, we analyze users\u2019 behavior and in-game created data in order to assess the dissemination strategies and qualitative aspects of the resulting corpus. We also report on classification experiments based on neural networks and feature-based models.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "cb53f9558bd13c853026f97dce3bbe3d989ca97d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ivan Habernal", "P.
