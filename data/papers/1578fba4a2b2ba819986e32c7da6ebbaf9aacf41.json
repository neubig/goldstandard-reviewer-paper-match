{"title": "CMU-01 at the SIGMORPHON 2019 Shared Task on Crosslinguality and Context in Morphology", "abstract": "This paper presents the submission by the CMU-01 team to the SIGMORPHON 2019 task 2 of Morphological Analysis and Lemmatization in Context. This task requires us to produce the lemma and morpho-syntactic description of each token in a sequence, for 107 treebanks. We approach this task with a hierarchical neural conditional random field (CRF) model which predicts each coarse-grained feature (eg. POS, Case, etc.) independently. However, most treebanks are under-resourced, thus making it challenging to train deep neural models for them. Hence, we propose a multi-lingual transfer training regime where we transfer from multiple related languages that share similar typology.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "1578fba4a2b2ba819986e32c7da6ebbaf9aacf41", "arXivId": "1907.10129", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10129.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Aditi Chaudhary", "Elizabeth Salesky", "G.
