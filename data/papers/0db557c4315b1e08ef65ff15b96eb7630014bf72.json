{"title": "Unnecessary utterance detection for avoiding digressions in discussion", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method for avoiding digressions in discussion by detecting unnecessary utterances and having a dialogue system intervene. The detector is based on the features using word frequency and topic shifts. The performance (i.e. accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure) of the unnecessary utterance detector is evaluated through leave-one-dialogue-out cross-validation. In the evaluation, we find that the performance of the proposed detector is higher than that of a typical automatic summarization method.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "0db557c4315b1e08ef65ff15b96eb7630014bf72", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Riki Yoshida", "Takuya Hiraoka", "Graham Neubig", "S.
