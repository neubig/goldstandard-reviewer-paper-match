{"title": "DDK rates in the paediatric clinic: a methodological minefield.", "abstract": "There are substantial differences in the norms reported for speech diadochokinetic (DDK) rates among several published studies. These may well be due to differences in type of data used, methods of data collection and DDK rate calculation. Such differences doubtless also exist in the calculation of DDK rate in routine clinical assessment. Methodological problems in DDK rate measurement are identified and discussed and a detailed protocol for DDK measurement is described.", "year": 1998, "ssId": "a4f2e6c38454c9e7b4068a456813d622b91f2663", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
