{"title": "Training data selection with user\u2019s physical characteristics data for acceleration-based activity modeling", "abstract": "This paper proposes an activity recognition method that models an end user\u2019s activities without using any labeled/unlabeled acceleration sensor data obtained from the user. Our method employs information about the end user\u2019s physical characteristics such as height and gender to find and select appropriate training data obtained from other users in advance. Then, we model the end user\u2019s activities by using the selected labeled sensor data. Therefore, our method does not require the end user to collect and label her training sensor data. In this paper, we propose and test two methods for finding appropriate training data by using information about the end user\u2019s physical characteristics. Moreover, our recognition method improves the recognition performance without the need for any effort by the end user because the method automatically adapts the activity models to the end user when it recognizes her unlabeled sensor data. We confirmed the effectiveness of our method by using 100\u00a0h of sensor data obtained from 40 participants.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "03b68259f9e70d2007d40e5331c9ff31f2bb46b9", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["T.
