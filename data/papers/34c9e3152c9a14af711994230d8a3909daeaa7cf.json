{"title": "Research Paper: Loss Functions, Axioms, and Peer Review", "abstract": "It is common to see a handful of reviewers reject a highly novel paper, because they view, say, extensive experiments as far more important than novelty, whereas the community as a whole would have embraced the paper. More generally, the disparate mapping of criteria scores to final recommendations by different reviewers is a major source of inconsistency in peer review. In this paper we present a framework inspired by empirical risk minimization (ERM) for learning the community\u2019s aggregate mapping. The key challenge that arises is the specification of a loss function for ERM. We consider the class of L(p, q) loss functions, which is a matrix-extension of the standard class of Lp losses on vectors; here the choice of the loss function amounts to choosing the hyperparameters p, q \u2208 [1,\u221e]. To deal with the absence of ground truth in our problem, we instead draw on computational social choice to identify desirable values of the hyperparameters p and q. Specifically, we characterize p = q = 1 as the only choice of these hyperparameters that satisfies three natural axiomatic properties. Finally, we implement and apply our approach to reviews from IJCAI 2017.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "34c9e3152c9a14af711994230d8a3909daeaa7cf", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ritesh Noothigattu", "Nihar B.
