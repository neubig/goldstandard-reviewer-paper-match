{"title": "Argumentation Quality Assessment: Theory vs. Practice", "abstract": "Argumentation quality is viewed differently in argumentation theory and in practical assessment approaches. This paper studies to what extent the views match empirically. We find that most observations on quality phrased spontaneously are in fact adequately represented by theory. Even more, relative comparisons of arguments in practice correlate with absolute quality ratings based on theory. Our results clarify how the two views can learn from each other.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "4302e981e3ec118b68e0b3fcf1820b3f6ecfa988", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Henning Wachsmuth", "Nona Naderi", "Ivan Habernal", "Yufang Hou", "Graeme Hirst", "Iryna Gurevych", "Benno Stein"]}
