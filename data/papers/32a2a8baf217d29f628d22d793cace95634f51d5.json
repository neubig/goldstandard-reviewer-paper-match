{"title": "CutOnce-Recipient Recommendation and Leak Detection in Action", "abstract": "Email has become increasingly ubiquitous in recent times bringing with it new problems. In this paper we revisit two such problems, namely information leak detection and recipient recommendation, and study the impact of previously proposed solutions on real email users. Previous work addressing these problems showed a lot of promise on static email corpora tests. In this paper, we implement these solutions in an integrated interface as an extension to Mozilla Thunderbird, a popular open source email client. By capturing data about the usage patterns in the extension, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms against baseline methods and address issues related to user interface design and implementation. Preliminary results from a user study show promising usage patterns, indicating that these features can benefit a large number of email users.", "year": 2008, "ssId": "32a2a8baf217d29f628d22d793cace95634f51d5", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ramnath Balasubramanyan", "Vitor R.
