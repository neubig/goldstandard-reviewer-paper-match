{"title": "Nonconvex-Nonconcave Min-Max Optimization with a Small Maximization Domain", "abstract": "We study the problem of finding approximate first-order stationary points in optimization problems of the form minx\u2208X maxy\u2208Y f(x, y), where the sets X,Y are convex and Y is compact. The objective function f is smooth, but assumed neither convex in x nor concave in y. Our approach relies upon replacing the function f(x, \u22c5) with its k-th order Taylor approximation (in y) and finding a near-stationary point in the resulting surrogate problem. To guarantee its success, we establish the following result: let the Euclidean diameter of Y be small in terms of the target accuracy \u03b5, namely O(\u03b5 2 k+1 ) for k \u2208 N and O(\u03b5) for k = 0, with the constant factors controlled by certain regularity parameters of f ; then any \u03b5-stationary point in the surrogate problem remains O(\u03b5)-stationary for the initial problem. Moreover, we show that these upper bounds are nearly optimal: the aforementioned reduction provably fails when the diameter of Y is larger. For 0 \u2a7d k \u2a7d 2 the surrogate function can be efficiently maximized in y; our general approximation result then leads to efficient algorithms for finding a near-stationary point in nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems, for which we also provide convergence guarantees.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "98290fb02a844108df202e9a6dc3461e3f14ee32", "arXivId": "2110.03950", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03950.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Dmitrii Ostrovskii", "Babak Barazandeh", "Meisam Razaviyayn"]}
