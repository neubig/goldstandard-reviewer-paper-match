{"title": "Safety Information Mining \u2014 What can NLP do in a disaster\u2014", "abstract": "This paper describes efforts of NLP researchers to create a system to aid the relief efforts during the 2011 East Japan Earthquake. Specifically, we created a system to mine information regarding the safety of people in the disaster-stricken area from Twitter, a massive yet highly unorganized information source. We describe the large scale collaborative effort to rapidly create robust and effective systems for word segmentation, named entity recognition, and tweet classification. As a result of our efforts, we were able to effectively deliver new information about the safety of over 100 people in the disasterstricken area to a central repository for safety information.", "year": 2011, "ssId": "947750c717a5fbd17fc52758322d1ca201c4c6bc", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Graham Neubig", "Yuichiroh Matsubayashi", "Masato Hagiwara", "Koji Murakami"]}
