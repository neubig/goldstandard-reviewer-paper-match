{"title": "Statistical Topological Data Analysis", "abstract": "Topological Data Analysis (TDA) refers to data analysis methods which study properties such as shape, topology and connectedness of the data. In this project we plan to study some of the key techniques used in TDA along with their established theoretical properties from a statistical perspective. TDA provides the data analyst with a set of tools to visualize and analyze a data sample. Below we give an overview of three such techniques summarized from [15], and then we take a deep dive into the density clustering and present some results from [6] which discusses how to construct confidence sets for density tree estimates. Assume that we observe a data sample X1, X2, . . .
