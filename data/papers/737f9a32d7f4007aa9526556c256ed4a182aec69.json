{"title": "Pricing design for robustness in linear quadratic games", "abstract": "We show that designing prices to induce a socially optimal Nash equilibrium that is robust to small parameter perturbations in a linear-quadratic game can be framed as a convex program. In addition, we use a similar analysis to develop convex conditions that guarantee that the induced equilibrium is stable with respect to small deviations in players' feedback strategies.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "737f9a32d7f4007aa9526556c256ed4a182aec69", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Daniel J.
