{"title": "Pricing for Coordination in Open\u2013Loop Differential Games", "abstract": "Abstract We provide a method for designing a quadratic pricing scheme to induce a desired local Nash equilibrium in an open-loop differential game with nonlinear dynamics. In addition, we present conditions when the induced equilibrium is a global equilibrium. The results are applied to the problem of inducing network managers to invest in security in a multi-network with an epidemic model of the spread of malware.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "92891a984b45df5fc764d81bf9bcd42e7e7ed1c7", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Daniel J.
