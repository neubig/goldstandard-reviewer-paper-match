Such a problem complicates both research and practical applications thwarting with the progress of the whole field. A specialized catalogue for linguistic resources may assist one in getting this problem solved. In this survey NLPub, a catalogue and a community for Russian linguistic resources is presented and compared with its analogs. Its data gathering and representation approaches are also described and the merotomy is demonstrated. The experience obtained since the project start is outlined and future work directions are stated.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "2bafaffe45ba66685c87e2d0a598222a9a68ae13", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Dmitry Ustalov"]}
