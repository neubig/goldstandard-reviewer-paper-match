{"title": "Multi-Vector Models with Textual Guidance for Fine-Grained Scientific Document Similarity", "abstract": "We present a new scienti\ufb01c document similarity model based on matching \ufb01ne-grained aspects of texts. To train our model, we exploit a naturally-occurring source of supervision: sentences in the full-text of papers that cite multiple papers together ( co-citations ). Such co-citations not only re\ufb02ect close paper relatedness, but also provide textual descriptions of how the co-cited papers are related. This novel form of textual supervision is used for learning to match aspects across papers. We de-velop multi-vector representations where vec-tors correspond to sentence-level aspects of documents, and present two methods for aspect matching: (1) A fast method that only matches single aspects, and (2) a method that makes sparse multiple matches with an Optimal Transport mechanism that computes an Earth Mover\u2019s Distance between aspects. Our approach improves performance on document similarity tasks in four datasets. Further, our fast single-match method achieves competitive results, paving the way for applying \ufb01ne-grained similarity to large scienti\ufb01c corpora. 1", "year": 2021, "ssId": "3d1cfefdbe40f7535ada772c260c192bb63bb9fe", "arXivId": "2111.08366", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08366.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Sheshera Mysore", "Arman Cohan", "Tom Hope"]}
