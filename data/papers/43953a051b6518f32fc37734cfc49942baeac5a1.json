{"title": "Intra-speaker spectral parameter variation between utterances of the same sentence and its prediction", "abstract": "In spectral conversion of statistical voice conversion technologies, distance measures between the converted and target parameters, such as mel-cepstral distortion, are often used as evaluation/training metrics. However, even if the same speaker utters the same sentence, the spectral parameters of those utterances vary, and therefore, a distance between them still exists. Moreover, in real-time conversion procedure, converted speech keeping original prosodic features of input speech is often generated due to an essential difficulty of complex conversion of those features in real time. In such a case, an ideal sample of converted speech will be a speech sample uttered by a target speaker imitating prosody of the input speech but a spectral variation caused by such a prosodic change is not considered in the current evaluation/training metrics. In this report, we investigate an intra-speaker spectral variation between utterances of the same sentence focusing on mel-cepstrum as a spectral parameter. Moreover, we propose a method for predicting it from prosodic parameter differences between those utterances and conduct experimental evaluations to show its effectiveness.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "43953a051b6518f32fc37734cfc49942baeac5a1", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["I.
