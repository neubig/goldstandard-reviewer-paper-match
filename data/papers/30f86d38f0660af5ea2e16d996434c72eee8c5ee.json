{"title": "ESPnet: End-to-End Speech Processing Toolkit", "abstract": "This paper introduces a new open source platform for end-to-end speech processing named ESPnet. ESPnet mainly focuses on end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), and adopts widely-used dynamic neural network toolkits, Chainer and PyTorch, as a main deep learning engine. ESPnet also follows the Kaldi ASR toolkit style for data processing, feature extraction/format, and recipes to provide a complete setup for speech recognition and other speech processing experiments. This paper explains a major architecture of this software platform, several important functionalities, which differentiate ESPnet from other open source ASR toolkits, and experimental results with major ASR benchmarks.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "30f86d38f0660af5ea2e16d996434c72eee8c5ee", "arXivId": "1804.00015", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00015.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Shinji Watanabe", "Takaaki Hori", "Shigeki Karita", "Tomoki Hayashi", "Jiro Nishitoba", "Y.
