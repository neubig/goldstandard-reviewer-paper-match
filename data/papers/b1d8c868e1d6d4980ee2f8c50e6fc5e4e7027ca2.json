{"title": "Telling Stories through Multi-User Dialogue by Modeling Character Relations", "abstract": "This paper explores character-driven story continuation, in which the story emerges through characters\u2019 first- and second-person narration as well as dialogue\u2014requiring models to select language that is consistent with a character\u2019s persona and their relationships with other characters while following and advancing the story. We hypothesize that a multi-task model that trains on character dialogue plus character relationship information improves transformer-based story continuation. To this end, we extend the Critical Role Dungeons and Dragons Dataset (Rameshkumar and Bailey, 2020)\u2014consisting of dialogue transcripts of people collaboratively telling a story while playing the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons\u2014with automatically extracted relationships between each pair of interacting characters as well as their personas. A series of ablations lend evidence to our hypothesis, showing that our multi-task model using character relationships improves story continuation accuracy over strong baselines.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "b1d8c868e1d6d4980ee2f8c50e6fc5e4e7027ca2", "arXivId": "2105.15054", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.15054.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Waiman Si", "Prithviraj Ammanabrolu", "Mark O.
