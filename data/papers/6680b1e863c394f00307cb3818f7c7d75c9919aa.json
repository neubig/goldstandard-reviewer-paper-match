{"title": "Interference alignment as a tool in network coding as applied to distributed storage", "abstract": "In this paper, we outline an approach to the task of designing network codes in a non-multicast setting. Our approach makes use of the concept of interference alignment. As an example, we consider the distributed storage problem where the data is stored across the network in n nodes and where a data collector can recover the data by connecting to any k of the n nodes and where furthermore, upon failure of a node, a new node can replicate the data stored in the failed node while minimizing the repair bandwidth.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "6680b1e863c394f00307cb3818f7c7d75c9919aa", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["K.
