{"title": "Non-Metric Space Library Manual", "abstract": "This document describes a library for similarity searching. Even though the library contains a variety of metric-space access methods, our main focus is on search methods for non-metric spaces. Because there are fewer exact solutions for non-metric spaces, many of our methods give only approximate answers. Thus, the methods are evaluated in terms of efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs rather than merely in terms of their efficiency. Our goal is, therefore, to provide not only state-of-the-art approximate search methods for both non-metric and metric spaces, but also the tools to measure search quality. We concentrate on technical details, i.e., how to compile the code, run the benchmarks, evaluate results, and use our code in other applications. Additionally, we explain how to extend the code by adding new search methods and spaces.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "2c2234548de4694b6455a19cd0d85a9d6c473456", "arXivId": "1508.05470", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.05470.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Bilegsaikhan Naidan", "Leonid Boytsov"]}
