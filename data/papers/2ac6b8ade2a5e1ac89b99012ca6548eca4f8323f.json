{"title": "Efficient Topological Layer based on Persistent Landscapes", "abstract": "We propose a novel topological layer for general deep learning models based on persistent landscapes, in which we can efficiently exploit underlying topological features of the input data structure. We use the robust DTM function and show differentiability with respect to layer inputs, for a general persistent homology with arbitrary filtration. Thus, our proposed layer can be placed anywhere in the network architecture and feed critical information on the topological features of input data into subsequent layers to improve the learnability of the networks toward a given task. A task-optimal structure of the topological layer is learned during training via backpropagation, without requiring any input featurization or data preprocessing. We provide a tight stability theorem, and show that the proposed layer is robust towards noise and outliers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by classification experiments on various datasets.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "2ac6b8ade2a5e1ac89b99012ca6548eca4f8323f", "arXivId": "2002.02778", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02778.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Kwangho Kim", "Jisu Kim", "Joon Sik Kim", "F.
