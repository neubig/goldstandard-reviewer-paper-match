{"title": "Understanding the impact of parking on urban mobility via routing games on queue-flow networks", "abstract": "We derive a new routing game model for urban centers that takes into account parking-related traffic along with all other traffic. In particular, we combine a queuing game model for on-street parking with a classical routing game to create a queue-routing game where parking traffic selects a parking zone (block-face) in addition to their route through the network. We show that this game is a potential game. We construct practical examples using subsections of the Seattle downtown area to illustrate the usefulness of this modeling paradigm and to examine how parking-traffic can impact overall congestion and the route choices of other drivers. By varying the cost of parking in different parking zones, we demonstrate that parking-related traffic can be adjusted to satisfy a particular objective.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "df56ccda14b5bc255a07fc061c50839e75563c5a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Daniel J.
