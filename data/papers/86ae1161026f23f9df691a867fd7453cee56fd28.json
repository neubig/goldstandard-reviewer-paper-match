{"title": "Semantic Change and Semantic Stability: Variation is Key", "abstract": "I survey some recent approaches to studying change in the lexicon, particularly change in meaning across phylogenies. I briefly sketch an evolutionary approach to language change and point out some issues in recent approaches to studying semantic change that rely on temporally stratified word embeddings. I draw illustrations from lexical cognate models in Pama-Nyungan to identify meaning classes most appropriate for lexical phylogenetic inference, particularly highlighting the importance of variation in studying change over time.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "86ae1161026f23f9df691a867fd7453cee56fd28", "arXivId": "1906.05760", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05760.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Claire Bowern"]}
