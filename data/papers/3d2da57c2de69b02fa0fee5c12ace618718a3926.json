{"title": "A Stacked Graphical Model for Associating Sub-Images with Sub-Captions", "abstract": "There is extensive interest in mining data from full text. We have built a system called SLIF (for Subcellular Location Image Finder), which extracts information on one particular aspect of biology from a combination of text and images in journal articles. Associating the information from the text and image requires matching sub-figures with the sentences in the text. We introduce a stacked graphical model, a meta-learning scheme to augment a base learner by expanding features based on related instances, to match the labels of sub-figures with labels of sentences. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the matching accuracy of the stacked graphical model (81.3%) as compared with a relational dependency network (70.8%) or the current algorithm in SLIF (64.3%).", "year": 2006, "ssId": "3d2da57c2de69b02fa0fee5c12ace618718a3926", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Zhenzhen Kou", "William W.
