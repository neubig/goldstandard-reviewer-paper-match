{"title": "A hearing impairment simulation method using audiogram-based approximation of auditory charatecteristics", "abstract": "Hearing impairment simulation is an effective technique to educate normal-hearing people about auditory perception of the hearing-impaired. Because auditory characteristics of the hearing impaired vary greatly from person-to-person, personalization of the hearing impairment simulation systems is essential to accurately simulate these individual differences. However, measurement of auditory characteristics of individuals is time-consuming work. In this paper, we propose a hearing impairment simulation method that is easily applied to individual hearing-impaired persons. Auditory filter characteristics and gain characteristics are estimated from easily measurable audiograms of each individual. We also implement a method for manually adjusting the hearing impairment level to improve accuracy of the proposed hearing impairment simulation. An experimental evaluation is conducted to compare intelligibility between hearing-impaired and normal-hearing persons with the proposed hearing impairment simulation. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively makes the word correct rate and phoneme confusion tendency of the normal hearing persons similar to those of the hearing impaired persons.
