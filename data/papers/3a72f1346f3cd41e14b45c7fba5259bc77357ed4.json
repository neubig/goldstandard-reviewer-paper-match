{"title": "Pac-learning Recursive Logic Programs: Negative Results", "abstract": "In a companion paper it was shown that the class of constant-depth determinate k-ary recursive clauses is efficiently learnable. In this paper we present negative results showing that any natural generalization of this class is hard to learn in Valiant's model of pac-learnability. In particular, we show that the following program classes are cryptographically hard to learn: programs with an unbounded number of constant-depth linear recursive clauses; programs with one constant-depth determinate clause containing an unbounded number of recursive calls; and programs with one linear recursive clause of constant locality. These results immediately imply the non-learnability of any more general class of programs. We also show that learning a constant-depth determinate program with either two linear recursive clauses or one linear recursive clause and one non-recursive clause is as hard as learning boolean DNF. Together with positive results from the companion paper, these negative results establish a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive function-free clauses.", "year": 1994, "ssId": "3a72f1346f3cd41e14b45c7fba5259bc77357ed4", "arXivId": "cs/9505105", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9505105.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["William W.
