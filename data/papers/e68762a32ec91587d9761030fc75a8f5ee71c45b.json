{"title": "Handling uncertain observations in unsupervised topic-mixture language model adaptation", "abstract": "We propose an extension to the recent approaches in topic-mixture modeling such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Topic Tracking Model for the purpose of unsupervised adaptation in speech recognition. Instead of using the 1-best input given by the speech recognizer, the proposed model takes confusion network as an input to alleviate recognition errors. We incorporate a selection variable which helps reweight the recognition output, thus creating a more accurate latent topic estimate. Compared to adapting based on just one recognition hypothesis, the proposed model show WER improvements on two different tasks.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "e68762a32ec91587d9761030fc75a8f5ee71c45b", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
