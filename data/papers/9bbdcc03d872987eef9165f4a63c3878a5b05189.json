{"title": "Condenser: a Pre-training Architecture for Dense Retrieval", "abstract": "Pre-trained Transformer language models (LM) have become go-to text representation encoders. Prior research fine-tunes deep LMs to encode text sequences such as sentences and passages into single dense vector representations for efficient text comparison and retrieval. However, dense encoders require a lot of data and sophisticated techniques to effectively train and suffer in low data situations. This paper finds a key reason is that standard LMs\u2019 internal attention structure is not ready-to-use for dense encoders, which needs to aggregate text information into the dense representation. We propose to pre-train towards dense encoder with a novel Transformer architecture, Condenser, where LM prediction CONditions on DENSE Representation. Our experiments show Condenser improves over standard LM by large margins on various text retrieval and similarity tasks.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "9bbdcc03d872987eef9165f4a63c3878a5b05189", "arXivId": "2104.08253", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08253.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Luyu Gao", "Jamie Callan"]}
