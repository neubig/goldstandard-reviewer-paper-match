{"title": "Federated Unsupervised Clustering with Generative Models", "abstract": "We consider the problem of clustering unlabeled datasets in the federated environment, where statistical heterogeneity can exist across clients. Compared to the centralized setting, the model-based solution for this problem remains relatively unexplored, possibly due to increased difficulty of training models with FedAvg algorithm under highly heterogeneous setting. A recently proposed Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA) addresses this issue by training multiple models that captures each cluster, and showed its effectiveness on supervised datasets, for the setting when the data are i.i.d. within the same client but separated across the clients. In this work, we develop UIFCA using generative models with IFCA framework, that solves for a more general setting where the data in the same client can also come from different clusters. For synthetic data, we observe that our method can correctly recover the cluster information of individual datapoints. We also provide analysis our method on MNIST dataset.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "978582ad754eab481856d62bdc7b0ee5bcf21811", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Jichan Chung", "Kangwook Lee", "K.
