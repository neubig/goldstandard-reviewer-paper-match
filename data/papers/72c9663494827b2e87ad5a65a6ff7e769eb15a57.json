{"title": "What Makes A Good Story? Designing Composite Rewards for Visual Storytelling", "abstract": "Previous storytelling approaches mostly focused on optimizing traditional metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE and CIDEr. In this paper, we re-examine this problem from a different angle, by looking deep into what defines a natural and topically-coherent story. To this end, we propose three assessment criteria: relevance, coherence and expressiveness, which we observe through empirical analysis could constitute a \u201chigh-quality\u201d story to the human eye. We further propose a reinforcement learning framework, ReCo-RL, with reward functions designed to capture the essence of these quality criteria. Experiments on the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST) with both automatic and human evaluation demonstrate that our ReCo-RL model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines on both traditional metrics and the proposed new criteria.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "72c9663494827b2e87ad5a65a6ff7e769eb15a57", "arXivId": "1909.05316", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05316.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Junjie Hu", "Yu Cheng", "Zhe Gan", "Jingjing Liu", "Jianfeng Gao", "Graham Neubig"]}
