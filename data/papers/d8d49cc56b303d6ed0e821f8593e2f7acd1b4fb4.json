{"title": "CONVOLUTION-AUGMENTED TRANSFORMER FOR SEMI-SUPERVISED SOUND EVENT DETECTION Technical Report", "abstract": "In this technical report, we describe our submission system for DCASE2020 Task4: sound event detection and separation in domestic environments. Our model employs conformer blocks, which combine the self-attention and depth-wise convolution networks, to efficiently capture the global and local context information of an audio feature sequence. In addition to this novel architecture, we further improve the performance by utilizing a mean teacher semi-supervised learning technique, data augmentation, and postprocessing optimized for each sound event class. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the event-based macro F1 score of 50.7% on the validation set, significantly outperforming that of the baseline score (34.8%).", "year": 2020, "ssId": "d8d49cc56b303d6ed0e821f8593e2f7acd1b4fb4", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Koichi Miyazaki", "Tatsuya Komatsu", "Tomoki Hayashi", "Shinji Watanabe", "T.
