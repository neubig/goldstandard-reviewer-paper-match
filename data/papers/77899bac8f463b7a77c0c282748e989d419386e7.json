{"title": "Semi-Supervised Learning with Declaratively Specified Entropy Constraints", "abstract": "We propose a technique for declaratively specifying strategies for semi-supervised learning (SSL). The proposed method can be used to specify ensembles of semi-supervised learning, as well as agreement constraints and entropic regularization constraints between these learners, and can be used to model both well-known heuristics such as co-training and novel domain-specific heuristics. In addition to representing individual SSL heuristics, we show that multiple heuristics can also be automatically combined using Bayesian optimization methods. We show consistent improvements on a suite of well-studied SSL benchmarks, including a new state-of-the-art result on a difficult relation extraction task.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "77899bac8f463b7a77c0c282748e989d419386e7", "arXivId": "1804.09238", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09238.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Haitian Sun", "William W.
