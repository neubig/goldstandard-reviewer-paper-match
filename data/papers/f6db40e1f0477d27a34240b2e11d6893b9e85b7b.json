{"title": "Making Healthy Air More Affordable: A Smart Air Purifier with Filter Availability Detection", "abstract": "The amount of people living in severely hazardous air quality conditions is rapidly increasing due to climate change, wildfires and pollution. Many affected people can not afford air purifiers to protect themselves and those that can are unaware of when is the optimal time to activate theirs. In response to these issues, we create an affordable air purifier that alerts users when the optimal time is to activate their filters and is universally accessible.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "f6db40e1f0477d27a34240b2e11d6893b9e85b7b", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Qian Zhao", "Dongbin Bai", "Yue Yu", "Yitong Shen", "Nicholas Ames", "J.
