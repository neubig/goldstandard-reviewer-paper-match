{"title": "Development of mapping system for distribution facility management", "abstract": "In the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPC), maps for managing the distribution facilities are essential to many jobs, including the planning, design, maintenance and operation of the facilities. To develop a mapping system with these distribution line maps, TEPC are making continued efforts to systematize the initial input and corrections of these maps, and the design jobs using a mapping database after the inputting has been finished. The most important feature of this system is the use of an automatic drawing reader and recognition technique, instead of a manual digitizer input device, for the initial input which represents a very large percentage of the mapping system cost. A project is under way to develop a design system for distribution facility construction works using the facility map database of the mapping system described. The authors outline major features and future developments of the mapping system for distribution facility management. >", "year": 1989, "ssId": "964293c1cb1b619eb9b474381d2ba60cf44fcc2d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["S.
