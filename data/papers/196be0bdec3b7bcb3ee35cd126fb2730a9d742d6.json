{"title": "Learning by Teaching SimStudent - Interactive Event", "abstract": "SimStudent is an educational software infrastructure which is designed to leverage the tutor effect in an on-line learning environment. Tutor effect is the phenomenon that students learn when they teach others. SimStudent allows students to learn by teaching a computer agent instead of their peers. SimStudent is a lively computer agent that inductively learns skills through its own tutored-problem solving experience. SimStudent is integrated into an on-line learning environment where students can interactively tutor SimStudent in how to solve equations [1].", "year": 2011, "ssId": "196be0bdec3b7bcb3ee35cd126fb2730a9d742d6", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Noboru Matsuda", "Victoria Keiser", "R.
