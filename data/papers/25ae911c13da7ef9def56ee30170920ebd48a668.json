{"title": "Which argument is more convincing? Analyzing and predicting convincingness of Web arguments using bidirectional LSTM", "abstract": "We propose a new task in the field of computational argumentation in which we investigate qualitative properties of Web arguments, namely their convincingness. We cast the problem as relation classification, where a pair of arguments having the same stance to the same prompt is judged. We annotate a large datasets of 16k pairs of arguments over 32 topics and investigate whether the relation \u201cA is more convincing than B\u201d exhibits properties of total ordering; these findings are used as global constraints for cleaning the crowdsourced data. We propose two tasks: (1) predicting which argument from an argument pair is more convincing and (2) ranking all arguments to the topic based on their convincingness. We experiment with feature-rich SVM and bidirectional LSTM and obtain 0.76-0.78 accuracy and 0.35-0.40 Spearman\u2019s correlation in a cross-topic evaluation. We release the newly created corpus UKPConvArg1 and the experimental software under open licenses.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "25ae911c13da7ef9def56ee30170920ebd48a668", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ivan Habernal", "Iryna Gurevych"]}
