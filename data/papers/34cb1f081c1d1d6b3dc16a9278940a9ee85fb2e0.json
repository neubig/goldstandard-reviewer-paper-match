{"title": "Automatic Estimation of Simultaneous Interpreter Performance", "abstract": "Simultaneous interpretation, translation of the spoken word in real-time, is both highly challenging and physically demanding. Methods to predict interpreter confidence and the adequacy of the interpreted message have a number of potential applications, such as in computer-assisted interpretation interfaces or pedagogical tools. We propose the task of predicting simultaneous interpreter performance by building on existing methodology for quality estimation (QE) of machine translation output. In experiments over five settings in three language pairs, we extend a QE pipeline to estimate interpreter performance (as approximated by the METEOR evaluation metric) and propose novel features reflecting interpretation strategy and evaluation measures that further improve prediction accuracy.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "34cb1f081c1d1d6b3dc16a9278940a9ee85fb2e0", "arXivId": "1805.04016", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04016.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Craig Alan Stewart", "Nikolai Vogler", "Junjie Hu", "Jordan L.
