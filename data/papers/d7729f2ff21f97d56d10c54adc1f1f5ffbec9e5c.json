{"title": "Treatment of Oral Leukoplakia Using Different SurgicalTechniques with Diode Laser", "abstract": "Oral premalignant lesions such as leukoplakia and erythroplakia remain a diagnostic and management challenge having a potential for malignant transformation. The management includes non-surgical and surgical therapies. The gold standard being laser excision. Lasers by far have been a well-established treatment modality for oral premalignant lesions and has potential advantages over surgical excision using scalpels. Various studies have shown the application of different lasers for the management of oral premalignant lesions showing effective outcomes. In the present study, the authors have described different surgical techniques to treat oral leukoplakia and have reported effective results with no recurrence.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "d7729f2ff21f97d56d10c54adc1f1f5ffbec9e5c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Sana Farista", "Aditi Chaudhary", "S.
