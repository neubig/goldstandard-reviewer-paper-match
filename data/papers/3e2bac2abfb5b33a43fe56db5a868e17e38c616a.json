{"title": "The Role of Student Projects in Teaching Machine Learning and High Performance Computing", "abstract": "We describe an approach to teaching Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing classes for Master students at Ural Federal University. In addition to the theoretical classes, the students participate in the projects in collaboration with the partner companies and research laboratories of the university and institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The partners provide not only project topics, but also the experienced mentors to assist the students in project work. We discuss the structure of the Project Workshop class that was designed to include the project-based learning into the curriculum. As a result, during the Master studies, the students not only learn the theoretical basis but also gain experience solving real-world problems, which has a positive effect on employment.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "3e2bac2abfb5b33a43fe56db5a868e17e38c616a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["A.
