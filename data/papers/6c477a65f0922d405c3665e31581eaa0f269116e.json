{"title": "Incorporating Both Distributional and Relational Semantics in Word Representations", "abstract": "We investigate the hypothesis that word representations ought to incorporate both distributional and relational semantics. To this end, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly optimizes a distributional objective on raw text and a relational objective on WordNet. Preliminary results on knowledge base completion, analogy tests, and parsing show that word representations trained on both objectives can give improvements in some cases.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "6c477a65f0922d405c3665e31581eaa0f269116e", "arXivId": "1412.5836", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5836.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Daniel Fried", "Kevin Duh"]}
