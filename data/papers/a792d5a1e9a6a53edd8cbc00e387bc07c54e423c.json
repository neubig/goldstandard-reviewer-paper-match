{"title": "A Simple Truth Serums for Massively Crowdsourced Evaluation Tasks", "abstract": "We consider the problem of eliciting truthful responses from agents in the absence of any known answers. This class of problems, pioneered by the peer-prediction method and the Bayesian truth serum, is now quite well studied in the literature. In this paper we propose new mechanisms that, unlike most works on this topic, require no extraneous elicitation from the agents, and furthermore allow the agents\u2019 beliefs to be (almost) arbitrary. Moreover, these mechanisms have the structure of output agreement mechanisms, which are simple, intuitive and have been quite popular in practice. These mechanisms operate under scenarios where the number of questions is large, and are suitable for most tasks in crowdsourcing and peer-grading.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "a792d5a1e9a6a53edd8cbc00e387bc07c54e423c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Vijay Kamble", "Nihar B.
