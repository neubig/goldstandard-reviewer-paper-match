{"title": "A structured wrapper induction system for extracting information from semi-structured documents", "abstract": "We propose an extensible architecture which allows wrapper-learning systems to be easily constructed and tuned. In this architecture the bias of the wrapper-learning system is encoded as an ordered set of \u201cbuilders\u201d, each associated with some restricted extraction language L. To implement a new builder it is only necessary to implement a small set of core operations for L. Builders can also be constructed by combining other builders. A single master learning algorithm which invokes the builders handles most of the real work of learning. The learning system described here is fully implemented, and is part of an \u201cindustrial-strength\u201d wrapper-learning system which has been used to extract job postings from more than 500 sites.", "year": 2001, "ssId": "53880036fb85cc737103c480c613e1912c416010", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["William W.
