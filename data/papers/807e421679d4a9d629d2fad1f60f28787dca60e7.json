{"title": "Semi-Supervised QA with Generative Domain-Adaptive Nets", "abstract": "We study the problem of semi-supervised question answering\u2014utilizing unlabeled text to boost the performance of question answering models. We propose a novel training framework, the Generative Domain-Adaptive Nets. In this framework, we train a generative model to generate questions based on the unlabeled text, and combine model-generated questions with human-generated questions for training question answering models. We develop novel domain adaptation algorithms, based on reinforcement learning, to alleviate the discrepancy between the model-generated data distribution and the human-generated data distribution. Experiments show that our proposed framework obtains substantial improvement from unlabeled text.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "807e421679d4a9d629d2fad1f60f28787dca60e7", "arXivId": "1702.02206", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02206.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Zhilin Yang", "Junjie Hu", "R.
