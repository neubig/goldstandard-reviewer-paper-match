{"title": "Non-verbal cognitive skills and autistic conditions: An analysis and training tool", "abstract": "The number of People who have trouble with social skills and communication is now greater than ever for a variety of reasons. Autism spectrum conditions are an extreme example of these traits. Our objective is to measure these autistic traits automatically, and enable people with social and communication difficulties to improve social and communication skills for use in the real world. This paper examines the relationship between non-verbal cognitive skills and position on the autism spectrum among members of the general population, and pre- and post-learning results were examined to find the effects of the training. The results showed an improvement after a 20-minute learning session, indicating that training could help enhance non-verbal cognitive skills for members of general population.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "d5181375d242ed181bcde0d682a3c7ec4c4c6102", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Hiroki Tanaka", "S.
