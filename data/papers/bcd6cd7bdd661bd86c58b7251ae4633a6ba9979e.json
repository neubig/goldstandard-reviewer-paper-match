{"title": "Recommending Papers by Mining the Web", "abstract": "The problem of assigning conference paper submissions to suitable reviewers can be viewed as a variant of the general problem of technical paper recommendation. In both cases one would ideally like to direct only those papers that are of the greatest interest to the appropriate set of people. Current attempts to automate the conference reviewing process have typically converted it into a task that requires reviewers to rate keywords and sift through long lists of abstracts to nd those that are appropriate for their interests and background. In this paper, we propose an automated method for recommending small focused sets of papers to reviewers. We show how intelligent paper recommendation can be performed by combining techniques from information retrieval and database technology, and by mining multiple information sources from the Web. We use abstracts of papers submitted to AAAI-98 and data mined from the home pages of its program committee members, and we evaluate our approach based on actual reviewing preferences given by the committee members.", "year": 1999, "ssId": "bcd6cd7bdd661bd86c58b7251ae4633a6ba9979e", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["C.
