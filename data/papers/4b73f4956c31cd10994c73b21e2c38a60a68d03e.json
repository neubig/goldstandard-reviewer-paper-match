{"title": "The Conference Paper Assignment Problem: Using Order Weighted Averages to Assign Indivisible Goods", "abstract": "Motivated by the common academic problem of allocating papers to referees for conference reviewing we propose a novel mechanism for solving the assignment problem when we have a two sided matching problem with preferences from one side (the agents/reviewers) over the other side (the objects/papers) and both sides have capacity constraints. The assignment problem is a fundamental problem in both computer science and economics with application in many areas including task and resource allocation. We draw inspiration from multi-criteria decision making and voting and use order weighted averages (OWAs) to propose a novel and flexible class of algorithms for the assignment problem. We show an algorithm for finding a $\\Sigma$-OWA assignment in polynomial time, in contrast to the NP-hardness of finding an egalitarian assignment. Inspired by this setting we observe an interesting connection between our model and the classic proportional multi-winner election problem in social choice.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "4b73f4956c31cd10994c73b21e2c38a60a68d03e", "arXivId": "1705.06840", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.06840.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Jinguo Lian", "Nicholas Mattei", "Renee Noble", "T.
