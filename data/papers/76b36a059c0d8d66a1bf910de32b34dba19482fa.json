{"title": "Run-and-back stitch search: novel block synchronous decoding for streaming encoder-decoder ASR", "abstract": "A streaming style inference of encoder\u2013decoder automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems is important for reducing latency, which is essential for interactive use cases. To this end, we propose a novel blockwise synchronous decoding algorithm with a hybrid approach that combines endpoint prediction and endpoint post-determination. In the endpoint prediction, we compute the expectation of the number of tokens that are yet to be emitted in the encoder features of the current blocks using the CTC posterior. Based on the expectation value, the decoder predicts the endpoint to realize continuous block synchronization, as a running stitch. Meanwhile, endpoint post-determination probabilistically detects backward jump of the source\u2013target attention, which is caused by the misprediction of endpoints. Then it resumes decoding by discarding those hypotheses, as back stitch. We combine these methods into a hybrid approach, namely run-and-back stitch search, which reduces the computational cost and latency. Evaluations of various ASR tasks show the efficiency of our proposed decoding algorithm, which achieves a latency reduction, for instance in the Librispeech test set from 1487 ms to 821 ms at the 90th percentile, while maintaining a high recognition accuracy.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "76b36a059c0d8d66a1bf910de32b34dba19482fa", "arXivId": "2201.10190", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10190.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["E.
