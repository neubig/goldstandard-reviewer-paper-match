{"title": "Pac-Learning Recursive Logic Programs: Efficient Algorithms", "abstract": "We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive logic programs in polynomial time from equivalence queries. In particular, we show that a single k-ary recursive constant-depth determinate clause is learnable. Two-clause programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and one constant-depth determinate nonrecursive clause are also learnable, if an additional \"basecase\" oracle is assumed. These results immediately imply the pac-learnability of these classes. Although these classes of learnable recursive programs are very constrained, it is shown in a companion paper that they are maximally general, in that generalizing either class in any natural way leads to a computationally difficult learning problem. Thus, taken together with its companion paper, this paper establishes a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive logic programs.", "year": 1994, "ssId": "9d698e034d83eedc05237e629eaad1c0c4e5bbb9", "arXivId": "cs/9505104", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9505104.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["William W.
