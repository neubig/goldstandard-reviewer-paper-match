{"title": "Sensitivity Analysis for Markov Decision Process Congestion Games", "abstract": "We consider a non-atomic congestion game where each decision maker performs selfish optimization over states of a common MDP. The decision makers optimize for their own expected cost, and influence each other through congestion effects on the state-action costs. We analyze the sensitivity of MDP congestion game equilibria to uncertainty and perturbations in the state-action costs by applying an implicit function type analysis. The occurrence of a stochastic Braess paradox is defined and analyzed based on sensitivity of game equilibria and demonstrated in simulation. We further analyze how the introduction of stochastic dynamics affects the magnitude of Braess paradox in comparison to deterministic dynamics.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "490c31b460316b7f68e9b8f5ff0d26aef2f7f45f", "arXivId": "1909.04167", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04167.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Sarah H.
