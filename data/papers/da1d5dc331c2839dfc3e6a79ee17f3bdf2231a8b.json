{"title": "Entity List Completion Using Set Expansion Techniques", "abstract": "Abstract : Set expansion refers to expanding a partial set of \"seed\" objects into a more complete set. In this paper, we focus on relation and list extraction techniques to perform Entity List Completion task through a two stage retrieval process. First stage takes given query entity and target entity examples as seeds and does set expansion. In second stage, only those candidates who have valid URI in Billion Triple dataset are ranked according to type match with given types. First stage of this system focuses on the recall while second stage tries to improve precision of the outputted list. We submitted the results on the Web as well as ClueWeb09 corpus.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "da1d5dc331c2839dfc3e6a79ee17f3bdf2231a8b", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Bhavana Dalvi", "Jamie Callan", "William W.
