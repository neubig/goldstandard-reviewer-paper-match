{"title": "A Novel Active Sampler Coupling Osmotic Pump and Solid Phase Extraction for in Situ Sampling of Organic Pollutants in Surface Water.", "abstract": "Active samplers for ambient monitoring of trace contaminants in surface water are highly desirable, but their use is often constrained by power supply. Here, we proposed a novel solution by coupling an improved osmotic pump (OP) with a solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge to construct a power-free active sampler for organic contaminants. The OP simply consisted of two cylindrical chambers separated by a reverse osmosis membrane. We, for the first time, added ion-exchange resins into the OP inlet chamber and successfully constructed OPs with a smooth and constant flow. In the OP-SPE sampler, water was continuously drawn through the SPE cartridge at a constant flow, and time-weighted average concentration over the sampling course may be easily calculated from the amount of target analytes retained on the SPE cartridge and water collected in the sampler. The OP-SPE samplers were deployed in a river to detect herbicides, and the measured concentrations were largely in agreement with the average of 11 daily spot samples. Given that a wide range of SPE cartridges are available for different classes of organic contaminants, this approach is versatile and may find widespread applications for in situ sampling of surface water under different conditions, including poorly accessible locations.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "bf7481685e63b85ef2586de3f6098f1a5fbe0e2d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kunde Lin", "Ling Zhang", "Quanlong Li", "Bingyan Lu", "Yue Yu", "Junxian Pei", "D.
