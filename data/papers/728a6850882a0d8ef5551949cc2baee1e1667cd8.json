{"title": "Bribery in Voting Over Combinatorial Domains Is Easy", "abstract": "We investigate the computational complexity of finding optimal bribery schemes in voting domains where the candidate set is the Cartesian product of a set of variables and agents' preferences are represented as CP-nets. We show that, in most cases, the bribery problem is easy. This also holds for some cases of k-approval, where bribery is difficult in traditional domains.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "728a6850882a0d8ef5551949cc2baee1e1667cd8", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nicholas Mattei", "M.
