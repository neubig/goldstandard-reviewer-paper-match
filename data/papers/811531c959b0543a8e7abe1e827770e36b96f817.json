{"title": "Word-level Emphasis Transfer in Speech-to-speech Translation | Article Information | J-GLOBAL", "abstract": "Speech-to-speech (S2S) translation systems [1] combine various technologies to help to translate speech across languages. However, most S2S systems ignore paralinguistic information such as emphasis. This paper attempts to solve the problem by proposing two new components: word-level emphasis estimation [2] using linear regression hidden semi-Markov models (LR-HSMM) [3], and emphasis translation that translates the word-level emphasis to a target language with conditional random fields (CRFs) [4]. The result shows that our system can accurately translate emphasis with 91.6% F -measure according to objective evaluation. A listening test with human subjects further showed that they could identify emphasized words with 87.8% F measure. This paper is a shortened version of our work presented in [5].", "year": 2016, "ssId": "811531c959b0543a8e7abe1e827770e36b96f817", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Quoc Truong Do", "Shinnosuke Takamichi", "S.
