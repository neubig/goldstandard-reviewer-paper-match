{"title": "Generating Sentences from Semantic Vector Space Representations", "abstract": "The first work of this kind in a monolingual setting successfully generates two and threeword phrases with predetermined syntactic structures by decoupling the task into three phases: synthesis, decomposition, and search [4]. During the synthesis phase, a vector is constructed from some input text. This vector is decomposed into multiple output vectors that are then matched to words in the vocabulary using a nearest-neighbor search.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "ccbc17d42f2b260079eee702fd97a75de705d8ac", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Mohit Iyyer", "Jordan L.
