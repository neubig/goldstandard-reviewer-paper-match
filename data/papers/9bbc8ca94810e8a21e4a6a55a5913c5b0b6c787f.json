{"title": "Efficient speech transcription through respeaking", "abstract": "We propose a method for efficient off-line speech transcription through respeaking. Speech is segmented into smaller utterances using an initial automatic transcript. Respeaking is performed segment by segment, while confidence filtering helps save supervision effort. We conduct detailed experiments comparing speaking vs. typing, sequential vs. confidence-ordered supervision, and examine the effect of the respeaking word error rate on correction efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only outperform typing in terms of correction efficiency, but is also much less demanding for the respeakers than traditional respeaking methods, consequently helping to keep costs down.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "9bbc8ca94810e8a21e4a6a55a5913c5b0b6c787f", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Matthias Sperber", "Graham Neubig", "C.
