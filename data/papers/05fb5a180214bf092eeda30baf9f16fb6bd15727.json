{"title": "Evaluation and Analysis of Duration Correction for Non-Native Speech Based on Waveform Modification", "abstract": "There are several attempts at correcting durational patterns of non-native speech towards language learning. One of the typical approaches modifies a speech parameter sequence with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) using native speech as the reference, generating corrected speech from the modified speech parameter sequence. Although this approach makes it possible to flexibly modify durational patterns of non-native speech, quality of the corrected speech significantly degrades due to the use of analysis-synthesis process to generate the corrected speech. In this report, we propose a method for correcting durational patterns using direct waveform modification for performing DTW. In calculating a temporal warping function, statistical voice conversion is effectively used to reduce an adverse effect caused by speaker differences. Moreover, phoneme insertion often observed in non-native speech is also handled. We conducted an experimental evaluation using English speech read by Japanese, demonstrating that the proposed method was capable of flexibly modifying durational patterns while avoiding quality degradation caused by the analysis-synthesis process. Furthermore, waveform segments suffering from quality degradation caused by temporal warping was analyzed using the modulation spectrum of spectral parameters.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "05fb5a180214bf092eeda30baf9f16fb6bd15727", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Kura Shinya", "Takamichi Shinnosuke", "T.
