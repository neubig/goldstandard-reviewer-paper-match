{"title": "Computer simulation of tumour resection\u2010induced brain deformation by a meshless approach", "abstract": "Tumour resection requires precise planning and navigation to maximise tumour removal while simultaneously protecting nearby healthy tissues. Neurosurgeons need to know the location of the remaining tumour after partial tumour removal before continuing with the resection. Our approach to the problem uses biomechanical modelling and computer simulation to compute the brain deformations after the tumour is resected. In this study, we use meshless Total Lagrangian explicit dynamics as the solver. The problem geometry is extracted from the patient\u2010specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and includes the parenchyma, tumour, cerebrospinal fluid and skull. The appropriate non\u2010linear material formulation is used. Loading is performed by imposing intra\u2010operative conditions of gravity and reaction forces between the tumour and surrounding healthy parenchyma tissues. A finite frictionless sliding contact is enforced between the skull (rigid) and parenchyma. The meshless simulation results are compared to intra\u2010operative MRI sections. We also calculate Hausdorff distances between the computed deformed surfaces (ventricles and tumour cavities) and surfaces observed intra\u2010operatively. Over 80% of points on the ventricle surface and 95% of points on the tumour cavity surface were successfully registered (results within the limits of two times the original in\u2010plane resolution of the intra\u2010operative image). Computed results demonstrate the potential for our method in estimating the tissue deformation and tumour boundary during the resection.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "652e3c774da47c0c8788111ec886a00d3b8fc637", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Yue Yu", "G.
