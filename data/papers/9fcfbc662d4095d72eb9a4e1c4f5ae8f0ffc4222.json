{"title": "Assessing lesion activity of secondary lesions on extracted teeth by thermal dehydration measurement and optical coherence tomography.", "abstract": "Secondary caries occurs when leakage in the interfaces between restorative materials and tooth structure allow fluid and bacterial acid infiltration. Thermal imaging coupled with dehydration can be used to measure this increase in fluid permeability for secondary lesions in teeth. Thermal imaging exploits the temperature change due to water evaporation during dehydration to measure the rate of water diffusion from porous lesion areas. Previous in vitro and in vivo thermal imaging studies on enamel and root surfaces have been promising for assessing natural lesion activity. In this study, the rates of dehydration for secondary lesions on extracted teeth were measured. The secondary lesions were also assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and correlated with dehydration rates to determine lesion activity. Future studies with \u03bcCT will be used to further confirm lesion severity and structure.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "9fcfbc662d4095d72eb9a4e1c4f5ae8f0ffc4222", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["N.
