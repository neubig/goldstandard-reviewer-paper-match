{"title": "Improving neural machine translation through phrase-based soft forced decoding", "abstract": "Compared to traditional statistical machine translation (SMT), such as phrase-based machine translation (PBMT), neural machine translation (NMT) often sacrifices adequacy for the sake of fluency. We propose a method to combine the advantages of traditional SMT and NMT by exploiting an existing phrase-based SMT model to compute the phrase-based decoding cost for an NMT output and then using this cost to rerank the n -best NMT outputs. The main challenge in implementing this approach is that NMT outputs may not be in the search space of the standard phrase-based decoding algorithm, because the search space of PBMT is limited by the phrase-based translation rule table. We propose a phrase-based soft forced decoding algorithm, which can always successfully find a decoding path for any NMT output. We show that using the phrase-based decoding cost to rerank the NMT outputs can successfully improve translation quality on four different language pairs.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "6c68866e6486923d2e8b999de57d450c9d4febab", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Jingyi Zhang", "M.
