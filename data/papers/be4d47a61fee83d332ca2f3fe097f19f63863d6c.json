{"title": "Node Clustering in Graphs: An Empirical Study", "abstract": "Modeling networks is an active area of research and is used for many applications ranging from bioinformatics to social network analysis. An important operation that is often performed in the course of graph analysis is node clustering. Popular methods for node clustering such as the normalized cut method have their roots in graph partition optimization and spectral graph theory. Recently, there has been increasing interest in modeling graphs probabilistically using stochastic block models and other approaches that extend it. In this paper, we present an empirical study that compares the node clustering performances of state-of-the-art algorithms from both the probabilistic and spectral families on undirected graphs. Our experiments show that no family dominates over the other and that network characteristics play a significant role in determining the best model to use.", "year": 2010, "ssId": "be4d47a61fee83d332ca2f3fe097f19f63863d6c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Ramnath Balasubramanyan", "Frank Lin", "William W.
