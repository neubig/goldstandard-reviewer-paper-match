{"title": "A Robust Estimation Method of Noise Mixture Model for Noise Suppression", "abstract": "Vector Taylor series (VTS)-based noise suppression usually employs a single Gaussian distribution for the noise model. How-ever, it is insuf\ufb01cient for non-stationary noise which has a multi-peak distribution. It is very complex to estimate multi-peak distribution of the noise, when we deal with the noise as ran-dom variables or hidden variables. To solve these problems, we investigate a way of estimating the noise mixture model by using a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimate of the noise. By iterating the MMSE estimation of noise and noise model estimation, the proposed method realizes the simulta-neous optimization of both the observed signal model and the noise model. The proposed method signi\ufb01cantly outperformed the VTS-based approach, and the maximum improvement in the word error rate was about 12%.", "year": 2011, "ssId": "7d7469e059c6890c24d42931c697df835329f26a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["M.
