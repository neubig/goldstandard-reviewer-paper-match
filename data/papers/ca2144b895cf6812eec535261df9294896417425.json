{"title": "Scientific Relation Extraction with Selectively Incorporated Concept Embeddings", "abstract": "This paper describes our submission for the SemEval 2018 Task 7 shared task on semantic relation extraction and classification in scientific papers. We extend the end-to-end relation extraction model of (Miwa and Bansal) with enhancements such as a character-level encoding attention mechanism on selecting pretrained concept candidate embeddings. Our official submission ranked the second in relation classification task (Subtask 1.1 and Subtask 2 Senerio 2), and the first in the relation extraction task (Subtask 2 Scenario 1).", "year": 2018, "ssId": "ca2144b895cf6812eec535261df9294896417425", "arXivId": "1808.08643", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08643.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yi Luan", "Mari Ostendorf", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"]}
