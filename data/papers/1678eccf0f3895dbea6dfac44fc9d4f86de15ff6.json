{"title": "Predicting Emotional Responses From Spontaneous Social-Affective Interaction Data \u2217 \u2606", "abstract": "The study of social-affective communication is concerned with the role of emotion in human interaction. Emotion plays a two way role in human conversation; we express our emotion and are affected by our conversational partner. This is yet to be completely replicated in human-computer interaction (HCI). In addition to the more traditional works on recognition and simulation, there has recently been an increasing interest in emotional triggers, studying what causes emotion in the first place. A recent study by Hasegawa et al. [1] addresses this issue by predicting and eliciting emotion in online conversation. We have followed up this study by performing a similar task on natural spoken conversation. We recognized emotion based on a speaker\u2019s utterances and analyzed the conversational partner\u2019s as the emotional triggers [2, 3]. In this paper, we extend upon the previous works by trying to predict a person\u2019s emotional reaction in a social-affective conversation. We examine not only the person having the reaction, but also their conversational partner. The prediction is aimed to accommodate the ability to predict the response to an emotion trigger. Two languages are examined: English and Indonesian.", "year": 2016, "ssId": "1678eccf0f3895dbea6dfac44fc9d4f86de15ff6", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Nurul Lubis", "S.
