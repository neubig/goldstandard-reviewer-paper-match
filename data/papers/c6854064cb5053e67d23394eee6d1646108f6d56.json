{"title": "Natural Language Inference from Multiple Premises", "abstract": "We define a novel textual entailment task that requires inference over multiple premise sentences. We present a new dataset for this task that minimizes trivial lexical inferences, emphasizes knowledge of everyday events, and presents a more challenging setting for textual entailment. We evaluate several strong neural baselines and analyze how the multiple premise task differs from standard textual entailment.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "c6854064cb5053e67d23394eee6d1646108f6d56", "arXivId": "1710.02925", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02925.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Alice Lai", "Yonatan Bisk", "J.
