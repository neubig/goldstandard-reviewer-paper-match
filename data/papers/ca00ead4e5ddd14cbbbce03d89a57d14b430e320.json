{"title": "Privacy and customer segmentation in the smart grid", "abstract": "In the electricity grid, networked sensors which record and transmit increasingly high-granularity data are being deployed. In such a setting, privacy concerns are a natural consideration. In order to obtain the consumer's valuation of privacy, we design a screening mechanism consisting of a menu of contracts offered to the energy consumer with varying guarantees of privacy. The screening process is a means to segment customers. Finally, we design insurance contracts using the probability of a privacy breach to be offered by third-party insurance companies.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "ca00ead4e5ddd14cbbbce03d89a57d14b430e320", "arXivId": "1405.7748", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.7748.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["L.
