{"title": "New Books", "abstract": "Beyer, D., Miidder, U.: Diagnostic Imaging of the Acute Abdomen. A Clinico-Radiologic Approach, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York: Springer 1988. XV, 453 pp., 250 Figs., (ISBN 3-540-17520-2), hard cover DM 180<. This translation of a German edition published in 1985 deals with all aspects of diagnostic imaging of the acute abdomen. There are chapters on imaging techniques and image analysis, radiographic, sonographic and computed tomography findings and diseases associated with the acute abdomen, providing a good general view and many details. A special chapter (40 pages) written by Benz-Bohm and Horwitz deals with the acute abdomen in children. Unfortunately, foreign bodies, volvulus and other topics in pediatric imaging appear in the other chapters. A few special pediatric problems are not addressed (i. e., fiat batteries). The English references are somewhat rare, although the numerous photographs are excellent. Many drawings support the informative text. To summarize, this is a helpful guide for students and doctors who treat the acute abdomen. J.
