{"title": "Implementation of real-time statistical voice conversion on a DSP", "abstract": "Real-time statistical voice conversion is one of promising approach to developing technology for body\u2013 conducted speech in silent speech communication and alaryngeal speech produced by alternative speaking methods for laryngectomees. Although it has been successfully implemented on devices with sufficient computational resources such as laptop PCs, an implementation in enviromments with limited resources such as portable devices would greatly contribute its practical use. In this report, we implement real-time voice conversion from non-audible murmur into whisper on a DSP for silent speech interfaces. To achieve real-time processing, we propose some methods for reducing computational cost while keeping conversion accuracy high. We conduct an experimental evaluations, which shows effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "8b48c55808636a52699b38869df3eba9c8b999d9", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Moriguchi Takuto", "T.
