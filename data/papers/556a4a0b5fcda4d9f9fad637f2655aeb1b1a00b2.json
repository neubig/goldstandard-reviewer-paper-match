{"title": "A method for translation of paralinguistic information", "abstract": "This paper is concerned with speech-to-speech translation that is sensitive to paralinguistic information. From the many different possible paralinguistic features to handle, in this paper we chose duration and power as a first step, proposing a method that can translate these features from input speech to the output speech in continuous space. This is done in a simple and language-independent fashion by training a regression model that maps source language duration and power information into the target language. We evaluate the proposed method on a digit translation task and show that paralinguistic information in input speech appears in output speech, and that this information can be used by target language speakers to detect emphasis.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "556a4a0b5fcda4d9f9fad637f2655aeb1b1a00b2", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Takatomo Kano", "S.
