{"title": "Parser combinators for Tigrinya and Oromo morphology", "abstract": "We present rule-based morphological parsers in the Tigrinya and Oromo languages, based on a parser-combinator rather than finite-state paradigm. This paradigm allows rapid development and ease of integration with other systems, although at the cost of non-optimal theoretical efficiency. These parsers produce multiple output representations simultaneously, including lemmatization, morphological segmentation, and an English word-for-word gloss, and we evaluate these representations as input for entity detection and linking and humanitarian need detection.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "6dfecb5915e8b10841abe224c5361bbda7100637", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Patrick Littell", "R.
