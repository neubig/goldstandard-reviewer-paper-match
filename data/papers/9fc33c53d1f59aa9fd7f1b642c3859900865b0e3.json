{"title": "Collectively Representing Semi-Structured Data from the Web", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a single low-dimensional representation of a large collection of table and hyponym data, and show that with a small number of primitive operations, this representation can be used effectively for many purposes. Specifically we consider queries like set expansion, class prediction etc. We evaluate our methods on publicly available semi-structured datasets from the Web.", "year": 2012, "ssId": "9fc33c53d1f59aa9fd7f1b642c3859900865b0e3", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Bhavana Dalvi", "William W.
