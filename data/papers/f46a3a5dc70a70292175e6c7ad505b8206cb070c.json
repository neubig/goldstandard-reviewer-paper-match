{"title": "The second \u2018CHiME\u2019 speech separation and recognition challenge: An overview of challenge systems and outcomes", "abstract": "Distant-microphone automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains a challenging goal in everyday environments involving multiple background sources and reverberation. This paper reports on the results of the 2nd `CHiME' Challenge, an initiative designed to analyse and evaluate the performance of ASR systems in a real-world domestic environment. We discuss the rationale for the challenge and provide a summary of the datasets, tasks and baseline systems. The paper overviews the systems that were entered for the two challenge tracks: small-vocabulary with moving talker and medium-vocabulary with stationary talker. We present a summary of the challenge findings including novel results produced by challenge system combination. Possible directions for future challenges are discussed.", "year": 2013, "ssId": "f46a3a5dc70a70292175e6c7ad505b8206cb070c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
