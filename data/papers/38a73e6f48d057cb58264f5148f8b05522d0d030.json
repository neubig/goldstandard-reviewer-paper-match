{"title": "A New Corpus for Context-Dependent Semantic Parsing", "abstract": "Semantic parsing is the task of translating natural language (NL) utterances into a machineinterpretable meaning representation (MR). Most approaches to this task have been developed and evaluated on a small number of existing corpora. While these corpora have made progress in semantic parsing possible, most of them cover rather narrow domains and context is rarely considered. In this paper we present a new set of guidelines for context-dependent semantic parsing and describe the annotation of a semantic parsing corpus. This new corpus covers a wider domain, namely tourismrelated activities in a city, and consists of 17 dialogs containing 2374 user utterances.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "38a73e6f48d057cb58264f5148f8b05522d0d030", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Andreas Vlachos", "S.
