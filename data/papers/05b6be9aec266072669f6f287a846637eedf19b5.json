{"title": "Effects of Experimental Warming and Canada Goldenrod Invasion on the Diversity and Function of the Soil Nematode Community", "abstract": "Both global warming and alien plant invasion can affect the biotic communities in the soil. Most studies are focused on the soil microbial community, but little is known about how global warming, along with alien plant invasion, affects the diversity and function of the soil nematode community. In this study, the individual and interactive effects of experimental warming and Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.) invasion on soil nematode communities were measured. Experimental air warming, in combination with different levels of S. canadensis invasion, were applied. The results showed that S. canadensis invasion significantly increased chao1, maturity, and structure indexes of the nematode community by 31.44%, 25.57%, and 329.3%, respectively, and decreased the basal index by 48.70% (all p < 0.05). Only the Simpson index was affected by the interaction between warming and S. canadensis invasion. Warming enhanced the S. canadensis invasion effect on the soil nematode community. The changes in nematode community were correlated with shifts in nutrient availability and resource stoichiometry, as well as microbes in the soil. These findings demonstrated that global warming and S. canadensis invasion may, directly and indirectly, alter the soil nematode community, which may considerably affect the functioning of underground food webs.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "05b6be9aec266072669f6f287a846637eedf19b5", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Guanlin Li", "Jingquan Wang", "Jiaqi Zhang", "Yingnan Li", "En-U Liu", "Yuechen Yu", "B.
