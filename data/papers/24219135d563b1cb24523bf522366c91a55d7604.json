{"title": "F1-Optimal Thresholding in the Multi-Label Setting", "abstract": "This paper investigates the properties of the widely-utilized F1 metric as used to evaluate the performance of multi-label classifiers. We show that given an uninformative binary classifier, F1-optimal thresholding is to predict all instances positive. More surprisingly, we prove a relationship between the optimal threshold and the best achievable F1 score over all thresholds. We demonstrate that macroaveraged F1, a commonly used multi-label performance metric, can conceal this extreme thresholding behavior. Finally, based on these properties of F1, we suggest average skill score as an alternative to macro-averaged F1 for multi-label classification.", "year": 2014, "ssId": "24219135d563b1cb24523bf522366c91a55d7604", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Zachary Chase Lipton", "C.
