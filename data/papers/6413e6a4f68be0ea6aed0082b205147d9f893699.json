{"title": "Morphological Inflection Generation Using Character Sequence to Sequence Learning", "abstract": "Morphological inflection generation is the task of generating the inflected form of a given lemma corresponding to a particular linguistic transformation. We model the problem of inflection generation as a character sequence to sequence learning problem and present a variant of the neural encoder-decoder model for solving it. Our model is language independent and can be trained in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. We evaluate our system on seven datasets of morphologically rich languages and achieve either better or comparable results to existing state-of-the-art models of inflection generation.", "year": 2015, "ssId": "6413e6a4f68be0ea6aed0082b205147d9f893699", "arXivId": "1512.06110", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.06110.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Manaal Faruqui", "Yulia Tsvetkov", "Graham Neubig", "Chris Dyer"]}
