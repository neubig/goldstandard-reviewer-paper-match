{"title": "LDA based User-Tag model for Automatic Image GeoTagging", "abstract": "Determining the precise location of the immense amounts of visual data on the internet would be beneficial to many applications, such as construction of detailed 3D location models and providing location-based services. In this work, we propose two latent dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based approaches to model user-tags for automatic geo-tagging of images. Specifically, as a first step in the task of geo-tagging, we consider the problem of determining a query photo\u2019s city of origin based on user-provided textual tags. Our first approach involves training separate LDA models for each city using images from Flickr, then comparing various likelihood metrics to obtain an estimate of the city location. We implemented this approach for eight cities and found classification accuracies ranging between 75% and 95%. The second approach involves finding a single LDA model for the entire dataset user-tags. The estimated posterior topic mixture provides a representation for each image in the topic space. Then, given a query image, task of location estimation is one of multi-label classification.", "year": 2011, "ssId": "697e6eecb0e77ba56c685bb99b221d959739d13b", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["K.
