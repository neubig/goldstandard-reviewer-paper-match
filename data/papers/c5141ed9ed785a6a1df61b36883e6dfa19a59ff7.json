{"title": "Building Corpora for Single-Channel Speech Separation Across Multiple Domains", "abstract": "To date, the bulk of research on single-channel speech separation has been conducted using clean, near-field, read speech, which is not representative of many modern applications. In this work, we develop a procedure for constructing high-quality synthetic overlap datasets, necessary for most deep learning-based separation frameworks. We produced datasets that are more representative of realistic applications using the CHiME-5 and Mixer 6 corpora and evaluate standard methods on this data to demonstrate the shortcomings of current source-separation performance. We also demonstrate the value of a wide variety of data in training robust models that generalize well to multiple conditions.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "c5141ed9ed785a6a1df61b36883e6dfa19a59ff7", "arXivId": "1811.02641", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02641.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Matthew Maciejewski", "Gregory Sell", "L.
