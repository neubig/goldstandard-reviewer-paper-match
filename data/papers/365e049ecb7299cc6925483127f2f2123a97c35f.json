{"title": "Kernel Change-point Detection with Auxiliary Deep Generative Models", "abstract": "Detecting the emergence of abrupt property changes in time series is a challenging problem. Kernel two-sample test has been studied for this task which makes fewer assumptions on the distributions than traditional parametric approaches. However, selecting kernels is non-trivial in practice. Although kernel selection for two-sample test has been studied, the insufficient samples in change point detection problem hinder the success of those developed kernel selection algorithms. In this paper, we propose KL-CPD, a novel kernel learning framework for time series CPD that optimizes a lower bound of test power via an auxiliary generative model. With deep kernel parameterization, KL-CPD endows kernel two-sample test with the data-driven kernel to detect different types of change-points in real-world applications. The proposed approach significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in our comparative evaluation of benchmark datasets and simulation studies.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "365e049ecb7299cc6925483127f2f2123a97c35f", "arXivId": "1901.06077", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.06077.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Wei-Cheng Chang", "Chun-Liang Li", "Yiming Yang", "B.
