{"title": "STATUS OF THE H INJECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AT LANSCE*", "abstract": "The H injector at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is being upgraded to provide a 12% duty-factor, 40-mA, 80-kev H beams, which will enable 200-\u03bcA operation of the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE) proton storage ring (PSR). An improved version of the LANSCE operational surface-conversion ion source and a new accelerating column have been developed in collaboration with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for this application [1]. We report here the results of the initial tests at LANL on a proof-of-principle (POP) ion source built at LBNL and on modeling studies. The POP ion source has been operated at the 40-mA design beam current, and the beam emittance of the 80-keV extracted beam has been measured both at the exit of the accelerating column and in the 80-keV lowenergy beam transport (LEBT) line. Significant, currentdependent, emittance growth was observed in the LEBT. Experimental investigations of this growth are described.", "year": 1999, "ssId": "bc4cb14af1023123b3122a5f0b6f3bb76334ffb4", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["W.
