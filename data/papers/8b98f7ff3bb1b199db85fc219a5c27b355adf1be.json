The present technique for osseous crown lengthening typically involves flap surgery, a procedure that frequently is associated with postoperative complications that can interfere with the aesthetic outcome, such as infection, bleeding, and change in tissue position during the healing process. The erbium laser enables the clinician to offer the patient a minimally invasive alternative to osseous crown lengthening negating the adverse effects associated with conventional treatment. Other advantages of using the laser for osseous crown lengthening includes: hemostasis, improved visualization, fewer postoperative complications and recession.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "8b98f7ff3bb1b199db85fc219a5c27b355adf1be", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Aditi Chaudhary"]}
