{"title": "Depth Separation for Neural Networks", "abstract": "Let $f:\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\\times \\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\\to\\mathbb{S}$ be a function of the form $f(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}') = g(\\langle\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}'\\rangle)$ for $g:[-1,1]\\to \\mathbb{R}$. We give a simple proof that shows that poly-size depth two neural networks with (exponentially) bounded weights cannot approximate $f$ whenever $g$ cannot be approximated by a low degree polynomial. Moreover, for many $g$'s, such as $g(x)=\\sin(\\pi d^3x)$, the number of neurons must be $2^{\\Omega\\left(d\\log(d)\\right)}$. Furthermore, the result holds w.r.t.\\ the uniform distribution on $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\\times \\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. As many functions of the above form can be well approximated by poly-size depth three networks with poly-bounded weights, this establishes a separation between depth two and depth three networks w.r.t.\\ the uniform distribution on $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\\times \\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.", "year": 2017, "ssId": "e60b88313fad52c1ef8dd02b482785651d09ad66", "arXivId": "1702.08489", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08489.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Amit Daniely"]}
