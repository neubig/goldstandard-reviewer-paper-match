{"title": "Cross-Lingual Transfer for Speech Processing Using Acoustic Language Similarity", "abstract": "Speech processing systems currently do not support the vast majority of languages, in part due to the lack of data in low-resource languages. Cross-lingual transfer offers a compelling way to help bridge this digital divide by incorporating high-resource data into low-resource systems. Current cross-lingual algorithms have shown success in text-based tasks and speech-related tasks over some low-resource languages. However, scaling up speech systems to support hundreds of low-resource languages remains unsolved. To help bridge this gap, we propose a language similarity approach that can efficiently identify acoustic cross-lingual transfer pairs across hundreds of languages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in language family classification, speech recognition, and speech synthesis tasks.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "8cfd299be05bf3df91e0bf656a7e2fb973056350", "arXivId": "2111.01326", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01326.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Peter Wu", "Jiatong Shi", "Yifan Zhong", "Shinji Watanabe", "A.
