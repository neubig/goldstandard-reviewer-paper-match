In this paper, we propose DATALAB, a unified data-oriented platform that not only allows users to interactively analyze the characteristics of data, but also provides a standardized interface for different data processing operations. Additionally, in view of the ongoing proliferation of datasets, DATALAB has features for dataset recommendation and global vision analysis that help researchers form a better view of the data ecosystem. So far, DATALAB covers 1,715 datasets and 3,583 of its transformed version (e.g., hyponyms replacement ), where 728 datasets support various analyses (e.g., with respect to gender bias) with the help of 140M samples annotated by 318 feature functions. DATALAB is under active development and will be supported going forward. We have released a web platform,1 web API, Python SDK,2, PyPI3 published package and online documentation,4 which hopefully, can meet the diverse needs of researchers.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "4e9328b2801e158647dff69606ed47d47045eca8", "arXivId": "2202.12875", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12875.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yanghua Xiao", "Jinlan Fu", "Weizhe Yuan", "Vijay Viswanathan", "Zhoumianze Liu", "Yixin Liu", "Graham Neubig", "Pengfei Liu"]}}

Spoken intent prediction, for example, combines automatic speech recognition and natural language understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, typically hold out examples for only the surface-level sub-task. As a result, models with similar performance on these benchmarks may have unobserved performance differences on the other sub-tasks. To allow insightful comparisons between competitive end-to-end architectures, we propose a framework to construct robust test sets using coordinate ascent over sub-task specific utility functions. Given a dataset for a decomposable task, our method optimally creates a test set for each sub-task to individually assess sub-components of the end-to-end model. Using spoken language understanding as a case study, we generate new splits for the Fluent Speech Commands and Snips SmartLights datasets. Each split has two test sets: one with held-out utterances assessing natural language understanding abilities, and one with heldout speakers to test speech processing skills. Our splits identify performance gaps up to 10% between end-to-end systems that were within 1% of each other on the original test sets. These performance gaps allow more realistic and actionable comparisons between different architectures, driving future model development. We release our splits and tools for the community.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "4cc07c367e4a1f932e159678ef711e1802edf49f", "arXivId": "2106.15065", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15065.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Siddhant Arora", "Alissa Ostapenko", "Vijay Viswanathan", "Siddharth Dalmia", "Florian Metze", "Shinji Watanabe", "A.

Prior work has considered extracting document-level entity clusters and relations end-to-end from raw scientific text, which can improve literature search and help identify methods and materials for a given problem. Despite the importance of this task, most existing works on scientific information extraction (SciIE) consider extraction solely based on the content of an individual paper, without considering the paper\u2019s place in the broader literature. In contrast to prior work, we augment our text representations by leveraging a complementary source of document context: the citation graph of referential links between citing and cited papers. On a test set of English-language scientific documents, we show that simple ways of utilizing the structure and content of the citation graph can each lead to significant gains in different scientific information extraction tasks. When these tasks are combined, we observe a sizable improvement in end-to-end information extraction over the state-of-the-art, suggesting the potential for future work along this direction. We release software tools to facilitate citation-aware SciIE development.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "21c9c624bc328686cef4bb1f80a786a5027d8886", "arXivId": "2106.01560", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01560.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Vijay Viswanathan", "Graham Neubig", "Pengfei Liu"]}}

Designing technology for image capture and sharing requires an understanding of how people use photos as well as how they adapt emerging technology to their photographic practices, and vice versa. In this paper, we report on an empirical study of the uses made of a prototype context-aware cameraphone application for mobile media sharing, and relate them to prior work on photographic practices. By reducing many of the barriers to cameraphone use and image sharing (including increasing image quality, easing the sharing process, and removing cost barriers), we find that users quickly develop new uses for imaging. Their innovative communicative uses of imaging are understandable in terms of the social uses identified from prior photographic activity; new functional uses are developing as well.", "year": 2005, "ssId": "3638e5dfc79ba3fb757900f46ac0c7e7f6dadb05", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["N.
