In many societies, these are handled behind the scenes as cultural taboos. Objectives: The study aims to address the effects of menstrual hygiene on excessive vaginal bleeding during and after delivery. Methods: The study used data from the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey. The study included 146,121 women aged 15-24 years from high focused states of India. Chi-Square analysis was used to examine the significance of menstrual hygiene on excessive vaginal bleeding during and after delivery. In addition, binary logistic regression was used for the assessment of the adjusted effects. Results: The prevalence of excessive vaginal bleeding during and after delivery ranged from 4.3 percent to 12.8 percent and 2.6 percent to 8.2 percent, respectively. Women who use hygienic method of protection to prevent blood stains during menstrual period were at lower risk of suffering from excessive vaginal bleeding during (OR = 0.80; 95% CI = [0.77, 0.84]) and after delivery (OR = 0.91; 95% CI = [0.86, 0.97]). Women who had terminated pregnancy, having higher BMI and lower level of education were also at higher risk.

Most, if not all, of these pre-trained models rely on the masked-language modeling (MLM) objective as the key language learning objective. The principle behind these approaches is that predicting the masked words with the help of the surrounding text helps learn potent contextualized representations. Despite the strong representation learning capability enabled by MLM, we demonstrate an inherent limitation of MLM for multilingual representation learning. In particular, by requiring the model to predict the language-specific token, the MLM objective disincentivizes learning a language-agnostic representation -- which is a key goal of multilingual pre-training. Therefore to encourage better cross-lingual representation learning we propose the DICT-MLM method. DICT-MLM works by incentivizing the model to be able to predict not just the original masked word, but potentially any of its cross-lingual synonyms as well.
