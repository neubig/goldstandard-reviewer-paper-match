The EH source opportunistically samples one or multiple processes over discrete time instants, and sends the status updates to a sink node over a time-varying wireless link. At any discrete time instant, the EH node decides whether to ascertain the link quality using its stored energy (called probing) and then, decides whether to sample a process and communicate the data based on the channel probe outcome. The trade-off is between the freshness of information available at the sink node and the available energy at the energy buffer of the source node. To this end, infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) theory is used to formulate the problem of minimization of time-averaged expected AoI for a single energy harvesting source node. The following two scenarios are considered: (i) energy arrival process and channel fading process are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across time, (ii) energy arrival process and channel fading process are Markovian. In the i.i.d. setting, after probing a channel, the optimal source node sampling policy is shown to be a threshold policy involving the instantaneous age of the process, the available energy in the buffer and the instantaneous channel quality as the decision variables. Also, for unknown channel state and energy harvesting characteristics, a variant of the Q-learning algorithm is proposed for the two-stage action taken by the source, that seeks to learn the optimal status update policy over time. For Markovian channel and Markovian energy arrival processes, the problem is again formulated as an MDP, and a learning algorithm is provided to handle unknown dynamics.

The design of such MAC protocols must keep in mind the need for contention access at light traffic, and scheduled access in heavy traffic, leading to the long-standing interest in hybrid, adaptive MACs. We first propose EZMAC, a simple extension of an existing decentralized, hybrid MAC called ZMAC. Next, motivated by our results on delay and throughput optimality in partially observed, constrained queuing networks, we develop another decentralized MAC protocol that we term QZMAC. A method to improve the short-term fairness of QZMAC is proposed and analysed, and the resulting modified algorithm is shown to possess better fairness properties than QZMAC. The theory developed to reduce delay is also shown to work in the presence of transmission errors and fast fading. Extensions to handle time critical traffic (alarms, for example) and hidden nodes are also discussed. Practical implementation issues, such as handling Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) errors, are outlined.

We derive an optimal threshold policy which tells the UE to take appropriate decision locally. Later, we give a simplified and easy to implement stationary threshold policy which counts the number of successive acknowledgement failures, based on which UE make appropriate decision locally. Through extensive simulation, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent algorithms.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "b3d9a0308ba6c4ca583a2b4e5be2b3eed466ccbc", "arXivId": "1910.14367", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.14367.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Durgesh Singh", "Arpan Chattopadhyay", "Sasthi C.

The goal herein is to develop optimal control policies for wireless networks. While classical methods such as value iteration and policy iteration have been employed to determine optimal policies in a moderate complexity manner; they still suffer from complexity challenges for very large scale networks. Previously, subspace approximation has been employed to find optimal controllers in reduced dimensions. Herein, an alternative approach is considered wherein the properties of the policy structure are exploited to determine solutions in a reduced dimension. The numerical results show that this new approach achieves a faster convergence rate with a negligible loss of performance.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "30c6be4c7f549a2ec7328d24ecc0a54fbf90d41c", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Libin Liu", "Arpan Chattopadhyay", "U.

Integral to proper functioning of C- ITS systems is sensing and telemetery. To this end, this paper examines how to ensure security in sensing systems for V2X networks. In particular, secure remote estimation of a Gauss-Markov process based on measurements done by a set of vehicles is considered. The measurements are collected by the individual vehicles and are communicated via wireless links to the central fusion center. The system is attacked by malicious or compromised vehicles with the goal of increasing the estimation error. The attack is achieved by two mechanisms: false data injection (FDI) and garbage packet injection. This paper extends a previously proposed adaptive filtering algorithm for tackling FDI to accommodate both FDI and garbage packet injection, by filtering out malicious observations and thus enabling secure estimates. The efficacy of the proposed filter is demonstrated numerically.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "f18ec4e0bce2e4d847954c9692959d88ba8a9b66", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Arpan Chattopadhyay", "U.
