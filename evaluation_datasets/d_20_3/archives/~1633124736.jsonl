However, the realization of high-performance SSLOBs is full of challenges due to the poor ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes, large interfacial resistance, and limited reaction sites of cathodes. Here, a flexible integrated cathode-electrolyte structure (ICES) is designed to enable the tight connection between the cathode and electrolyte through supporting them on a 3D SiO2 nanofibers (NFs) framework. The intimate cathode-electrolyte structure and the porous SiO2 NFs scaffold combination are favorable for decreasing interfacial resistance and increasing reaction sites. Moreover, the 3D SiO2 NFs framework can also behave as an efficient inorganic filler to enhance the ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolyte and its ability to inhibit lithium dendrite growth. As a result, the elaborately designed ICES can simultaneously tackle the issues that limit the performance liberation of SSLOBs, making the batteries deliver a high discharge capacity and a long lifetime of 145 cycles with a cycling capacity of 1000 mAh g-1 at 60\u00a0\u00b0C, much superior to coventional SSLOBs (50 cycles).", "year": 2022, "ssId": "14119210e5f9e0d962e329c833557dfb5524c4bd", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["C.

The solver with lower fidelity (coarse) is responsible for simulating domains with homogeneous features, whereas the expensive high-fidelity (fine) model describes microscopic features with refined discretization, often making the overall cost prohibitively high, especially for timedependent problems. In this work, we explore the idea of multiscale modeling with machine learning and employ DeepONet, a neural operator, as an efficient surrogate of the expensive solver. DeepONet is trained offline using data acquired from the fine solver for learning the underlying and possibly unknown finescale dynamics. It is then coupled with standard PDE solvers for predicting the multiscale systems with new boundary/initial conditions in the coupling stage. The proposed framework significantly reduces the computational cost of multiscale simulations since the DeepONet inference cost is negligible, facilitating readily the incorporation of a plurality of interface conditions and coupling schemes. We present various benchmarks to assess accuracy and speedup, and in particular we develop a coupling algorithm for a timedependent problem, and we also demonstrate coupling of a continuum model (finite element methods, FEM) with a neural operator representation of a particle system (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, SPH) for a uniaxial tension problem with hyperelastic material.

However, when constitutive laws are unknown or when defects and/or high degrees of heterogeneity are present, these classical models may become inaccurate. In this work, we propose to use data-driven modeling, which directly utilizes high-fidelity simulation and/or experimental measurements to predict a material\u2019s response without using conventional constitutive models. Specifically, the material response is modeled by learning the implicit mappings between loading conditions and the resultant displacement and/or damage fields, with the neural network serving as a surrogate for a solution operator. To model the complex responses due to material heterogeneity and defects, we develop a novel deep neural operator architecture, which we coin as the Implicit Fourier Neural Operator (IFNO). In the IFNO, the increment between layers is modeled as an integral operator to capture the long-range dependencies in the feature space. As the network gets deeper, the limit of IFNO becomes a fixed point equation that yields an implicit neural operator and naturally mimics the displacement/damage fields solving procedure in material modeling problems. To obtain an efficient implementation, we parameterize the integral kernel of this integral operator directly in the Fourier space and interpret the network as discretized integral (nonlocal) differential equations, which consequently allow for the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and accelerated learning techniques for deep networks. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method for a number of examples, including hyperelastic, anisotropic and brittle materials. As an application, we further employ the proposed approach to learn the material models directly from digital image correlation (DIC) tracking measurements, and show that the learned solution operators substantially outperform the conventional constitutive models in predicting displacement fields.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "d8551a4b49aa547ad8884ba9f545480860fcadd1", "arXivId": "2203.08205", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08205.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Huaiqian You", "Quinn Zhang", "Colton J.

The cyclooctene epoxidation results with H2O2 as the oxidant demonstrated that PMo11Fe/SBA performed better catalytic activities and recyclability, the conversion of cyclooctene kept about 50% after several recycled reactions. The superior recyclability of PMo11Fe/SBA could be attributed to the multiple electrostatic and coordinative interactions between PMo11Fe clusters and functionalities \u2013NH2 located at the 3D pore wall of SBA-15. Besides, the catalytic activities and stability could be improved through the partial substitute of transition metal Fe instead of Mo atom in phosphomolybdic acids clusters.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "1d255aeabcb87929742280251007fd8c01bbe914", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Xiaolu Chen", "Jing Wang", "Yue Yu", "Hong-Jian Chen", "X.

A Comparative Analysis of New Users on WallstreetBets During the Gamestop Short-squeeze", "abstract": "WallStreetBets (WSB) is a Reddit community that primarily discusses high-risk options and stock trading. In January 2021, it attracted worldwide attention as one of the epicentres of a significant short squeeze on US markets. Following this event, the number of users and their activity increased exponentially. In this paper, we study the changes caused in the WSB community by such an increase in activity. We perform a comparative analysis between long-term users and newcomers and examine their respective writing styles, topics, and susceptibility to community feedback. We report a significant difference in the post length and the number of emojis between the regular and new users joining WSB. Newer users\u2019 activity also closely follows the affected companies\u2019 stock prices. Finally, although community feedback affects the choices of topics for all users, new users are less prone to select their subsequent message topics based on past community feedback.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "99546b4d1f2547095bb15eec36e03f64b74a78d4", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["E.
