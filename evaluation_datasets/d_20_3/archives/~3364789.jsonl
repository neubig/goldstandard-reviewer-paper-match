However, manually curating a large and rapidly-evolving taxonomy is infeasible. In this work, we propose Arborist, an approach to automatically expand textual taxonomies by predicting the parents of new taxonomy nodes. Unlike previous work, Arborist handles the more challenging scenario of taxonomies with heterogeneous edge semantics that are unobserved. Arborist learns latent representations of the edge semantics along with embeddings of the taxonomy nodes to measure taxonomic relatedness between node pairs. Arborist is then trained by optimizing a large-margin ranking loss with a dynamic margin function. We propose a principled formulation of the margin function, which theoretically guarantees that Arborist minimizes an upper-bound on the shortest-path distance between the predicted parents and actual parents in the taxonomy. Via extensive evaluation on a curated taxonomy at Pinterest and several public datasets, we demonstrate that Arborist outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 59% in mean reciprocal rank and 83% in recall at 15. We also explore the ability of Arborist to infer nodes\u2019 taxonomic-roles, without explicit supervision on this task.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "9fe09ca520cb7ce106e65b39c455777d18ec6efe", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Emaad Manzoor", "Rui Li", "Dhananjay Shrouty", "J.

However, biases in the text written for members of different subgroups (such as in recommendation letters for male and non-male candidates), though widely reported anecdotally, remain challenging to quantify. In this work, we introduce a novel framework to quantify bias in text caused by the visibility of subgroup membership indicators. We develop a nonparametric estimation and inference procedure to estimate this bias. We then formalize an identification strategy to causally link the estimated bias to the visibility of subgroup membership indicators, provided observations from time periods both before and after an identity-hiding policy change. We identify an application wherein \"ground truth\" bias can be inferred to evaluate our framework, instead of relying on synthetic or secondary data. Specifically, we apply our framework to quantify biases in the text of peer reviews from a reputed machine learning conference before and after the conference adopted a double-blind reviewing policy. We show evidence of biases in the review ratings that serves as \"ground truth\", and show that our proposed framework accurately detects these biases from the review text without having access to the review ratings.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "cc19de8d0782917098029ed20261cbe0b0c62bf5", "arXivId": "2010.15300", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15300.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Emaad Manzoor", "Nihar B.

Yet, the determinants of opinion-change via persuasion in deliberation online remain largely unexplored. Our research examines the persuasive power of $\\textit{ethos}$ -- an individual's \"reputation\" -- using a 7-year panel of over a million debates from an argumentation platform containing explicit indicators of successful persuasion. We identify the causal effect of reputation on persuasion by constructing an instrument for reputation from a measure of past debate competition, and by controlling for unstructured argument text using neural models of language in the double machine-learning framework. We find that an individual's reputation significantly impacts their persuasion rate above and beyond the validity, strength and presentation of their arguments. In our setting, we find that having 10 additional reputation points causes a 31% increase in the probability of successful persuasion over the platform average. We also find that the impact of reputation is moderated by characteristics of the argument content, in a manner consistent with a theoretical model that attributes the persuasive power of reputation to heuristic information-processing under cognitive overload. We discuss managerial implications for platforms that facilitate deliberative decision-making for public and private organizations online.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "05f8dd59d4184d38e240bdea4d58e424b8cd055c", "arXivId": "2006.00707", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00707.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Emaad Manzoor", "George H.

Compared to 4 interpretable baselines, FCM attains higher interpretability as quantified by 2 human-judged metrics and 1 automated metric, and higher recall of unique concepts as supported by several experiments. In addition, FCM extracted constructs relating to product quality theorized to impact conversion in literature, without being explicitly trained to do so. FCM also achieves superior predictive performance compared to 4 interpretable benchmarks while maintaining superior or competitive predictive performance compared to 8 blackbox classifiers. In further experiments, we evaluate FCM on text data from online newsgroups and a crowdfunding platform, investigate the impact of focusing on concept discovery, and study the interpretability-accuracy trade-off.

Our proposed model RUSH!

This problem is motivated by and generalizes from its application in security to host-level advanced persistent threat (APT) detection. We propose StreamSpot, a clustering based anomaly detection approach that addresses challenges in two key fronts: (1) heterogeneity, and (2) streaming nature. We introduce a new similarity function for heterogeneous graphs that compares two graphs based on their relative frequency of local substructures, represented as short strings. This function lends itself to a vector representation of a graph, which is (a) fast to compute, and (b) amenable to a sketched version with bounded size that preserves similarity. StreamSpot exhibits desirable properties that a streaming application requires: it is (i) fully-streaming; processing the stream one edge at a time as it arrives, (ii) memory-efficient; requiring constant space for the sketches and the clustering, (iii) fast; taking constant time to update the graph sketches and the cluster summaries that can process over 100,000 edges per second, and (iv) online; scoring and flagging anomalies in real time.

However, formal study is lacking on both the timing and frequency problems. We study for the first time the broadcast scheduling problem of specifying the timing and frequency of publishing content to maximise the attention received. \nWe validate and quantify three interacting behavioural phenomena to parametrise social platform users: information overload, bursty circadian rhythms and monotony aversion, which is defined here for the first time.
