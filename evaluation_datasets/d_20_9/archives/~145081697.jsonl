Despite a close association between glucose and lipid metabolisms, the influence of elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) on plaque vulnerability and lipid variability remains unclear. Methods Among subjects undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from 2009 through 2019, 366 patients received intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) assessment and 4,445 patients underwent the scheduled follow-ups within 1 year after PCI. Vulnerability features of culprit vessels were analyzed by OCT examination, including the assessment of lipid, macrophage, calcium, and minimal fibrous cap thickness (FCT). Visit-to-visit lipid variability was determined by different definitions including standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and variability independent of the mean (VIM). Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to verify the influence of HbA1c on plaque vulnerability features and lipid variability. Exploratory analyses were also performed in non-diabetic patients. Results Among enrolled subjects, the pre-procedure HbA1c was 5.90 \u00b1 1.31%, and the average follow-up HbA1c was 5.98 \u00b1 1.16%. By OCT assessment, multivariable linear regression analyses demonstrated that patients with elevated HbA1c had a thinner minimal FCT (\u03b2 = \u22126.985, P = 0.048), greater lipid index (LI) (\u03b2 = 226.299, P = 0.005), and higher macrophage index (\u03b2 = 54.526, P = 0.045). Even in non-diabetic patients, elevated HbA1c also linearly decreased minimal FCT (\u03b2 = \u221214.011, P = 0.036), increased LI (\u03b2 = 290.048, P = 0.041) and macrophage index (\u03b2 = 120.029, P = 0.048). Subsequently, scheduled follow-ups were performed during 1-year following PCI. Multivariable linear regression analyses proved that elevated average follow-up HbA1c levels increased the VIM of lipid profiles, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (\u03b2 = 2.594, P < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (\u03b2 = 0.461, P = 0.044), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (\u03b2 = 1.473, P < 0.001), total cholesterol (\u03b2 = 0.947, P < 0.001), and triglyceride (\u03b2 = 4.217, P < 0.001). The result was consistent in non-diabetic patients and was verified when SD and CV were used to estimate variability. Conclusion In patients undergoing elective PCI, elevated HbA1c increases the atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and the visit-to-visit variability of lipid profiles, which is consistent in non-diabetic patients.", "year": 2022, "ssId": "a3da7028a1b721e392c421c2f15096abb1a71afb", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["Duanbin Li", "Ya Li", "Cao Wang", "Hangpan Jiang", "Liding Zhao", "Xu-Lin Hong", "Maoning Lin", "Yi Luan", "Xiaohua Shen", "Zhaoyang Chen", "Wenbin Zhang"]}}

At present, the mechanism and effect of statins on PC-AKI and its mechanism are still unclear. Methods: It was a multicenter retrospective obeservational study. We reviewed 4386 patients who underwent CAG or PCI, with serum creatinine recorded pre- or post-procedure within 72hrs after PCI, from December, 2006 to December, 2019 admitted to Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital and its medical consortium hospitals. Multivariate logical regression was used to explore whether preoperative use of statins was a protective factor for PC-AKI, and then path analysis model was used to explore the specific mechanism of statins. Results: In total, 4386 patients were enrolled in the study, the mean age was 67 yrs old, 17.9% with PC-AKI, 83.3% with pre-operative statin therapy. The incidence of PC-AKI was significantly lower in statin therapy group than non-statins therapy group. Multivariate regression indicated that pre-operative statin therapy was significantly negatively associated with percentage of elevated creatinine (\u03b2: -0.118, p<0.001) and PC-AKI (OR: 0.575, p<0.001). In pre-operative statin therapy group, no statistically significant deference was detected between atorvastatin and rosuvastatin group (OR: 1.052, p=0.558). Pathway model analysis indicated the direct protective effectiveness of pre-operative statin therapy on PC-AKI (p<0.001), but neither with its lipid-lowering effect (p=0.277) nor anti-inflammatory effect (p=0.596).

Due to the limitation of available parallel corpora, the model is trained in a semi-supervised way, by using the output of a knowledge-based high performance aligning system. We apply the resulting similarity score to rescore the knowledge-based output, and adapt the model by a small hand-aligned dataset. Experiments show that both rescoring and adaptation improve the performance of knowledge-based method.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "8b3c0dd95167d4d63161038493a691ee5cdc76b3", "arXivId": "1809.08703", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08703.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yonghui Huang", "Yunhui Li", "Yi Luan"]}}

We create SciERC, a dataset that includes annotations for all three tasks and develop a unified framework called SciIE with shared span representations. The multi-task setup reduces cascading errors between tasks and leverages cross-sentence relations through coreference links. Experiments show that our multi-task model outperforms previous models in scientific information extraction without using any domain-specific features. We further show that the framework supports construction of a scientific knowledge graph, which we use to analyze information in scientific literature.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "b21b927c251c415b601b6d7f785a42cc5c292635", "arXivId": "1808.09602", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09602.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Yi Luan", "Luheng He", "Mari Ostendorf", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi"]}}
