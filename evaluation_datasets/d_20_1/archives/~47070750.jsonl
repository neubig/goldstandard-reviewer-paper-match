In this work, we introduce execution result\u2013 based minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBREXEC) for program selection and show that it improves the few-shot performance of pretrained code models on natural-language-tocode tasks. We select output programs from a generated candidate set by marginalizing over program implementations that share the same semantics. Because exact equivalence is intractable, we execute each program on a small number of test inputs to approximate semantic equivalence.
