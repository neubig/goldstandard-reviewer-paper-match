Even with the recent advances in NLP research space, the state-of-the-art QA systems fall short of understanding implicit intents of real-world Business Intelligence (BI) queries in enterprise systems, since Natural Language Understanding still remains an AI-hard problem. We posit that deploying ontology reasoning over domain semantics can help in achieving better natural language understanding for QA systems. In this paper, we specifically focus on building a Schema Aware Semantic Reasoning Framework that translates natural language interpretation as a sequence of solvable tasks by an ontology reasoner. We apply our framework on top of an ontology based, state-of-the-art natural language question-answering system ATHENA, and experiment with 4 benchmarks focused on BI queries. Our experimental numbers empirically show that the Schema Aware Semantic Reasoning indeed helps in achieving significantly better results for handling BI queries with an average accuracy improvement of ~30%", "year": 2020, "ssId": "582089a00a6c9fb534f16d1dbbafc50cc4e3912a", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["J.

These problems are majorly being tackled by using deep neural network architectures, usually Convolutional Neural Networks, which are surpassing other approaches by a large margin in terms of accuracy. But there remain quite a few drawbacks and limitations to this approach in terms of efficiency. Therefore, we review a newly introduced concept of encapsulation of auto-encoders, to give a multi-dimensional representation to the given scene, as an efficient alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks. This paper also proposes a novel use case for Capsule Networks to be used in Semantic Segmentation, a possibility which has never been solitarily explored before.", "year": 2019, "ssId": "5ebe542ee1a7eab7aad8e36ed53dbdd7ebd98c8d", "arXivId": null, "link": null, "openAccess": false, "authors": ["S.
