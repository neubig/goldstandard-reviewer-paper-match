Existing control methods either tackle the HJB directly with grid-based PDE solvers, or resort to iterative stochastic path sampling to obtain the necessary controls. Here, we present a framework that interpolates between these two approaches. By reformulating the optimal interventions in terms of logarithmic gradients ( scores ) of two forward probability flows, and by employing deterministic particle methods for solving Fokker-Planck equations, we introduce a novel fully deterministic framework that computes the required optimal interventions in one shot.", "year": 2021, "ssId": "d26a7a86013b3be57acc0f5df73393cab7c302d9", "arXivId": "2110.13020", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13020.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Dimitra Maoutsa", "M.

Although broadly used, they allow for analytical treatment only in limited settings, and often it is inevitable to resort to numerical solutions. Here, we develop a computational approach for simulating the time evolution of Fokker\u2013Planck solutions in terms of a mean field limit of an interacting particle system. The interactions between particles are determined by the gradient of the logarithm of the particle density, approximated here by a novel statistical estimator. The performance of our method shows promising results, with more accurate and less fluctuating statistics compared to direct stochastic simulations of comparable particle number. Taken together, our framework allows for effortless and reliable particle-based simulations of Fokker\u2013Planck equations in low and moderate dimensions. The proposed gradient\u2013log\u2013density estimator is also of independent interest, for example, in the context of optimal control.", "year": 2020, "ssId": "4a76869cda286efb20eb78cc6adb13daab37a0d1", "arXivId": "2006.00702", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00702.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Dimitra Maoutsa", "S.

Here we propose a theory for revealing physical connectivity of networked systems only from the event time series their intrinsic collective dynamics generate. Representing the patterns of event timings in an event space spanned by interevent and cross-event intervals, we reveal which other units directly influence the interevent times of any given unit. For illustration, we linearize an event-space mapping constructed from the spiking patterns in model neural circuits to reveal the presence or absence of synapses between any pair of neurons, as well as whether the coupling acts in an inhibiting or activating (excitatory) manner. The proposed model-independent reconstruction theory is scalable to larger networks and may thus play an important role in the reconstruction of networks from biology to social science and engineering.", "year": 2018, "ssId": "7d148b46f45e935765e56887d720492b2b716e55", "arXivId": "1803.09974", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09974.pdf", "openAccess": true, "authors": ["Jose Casadiego", "Dimitra Maoutsa", "M.
